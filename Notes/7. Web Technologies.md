## 1. Introduction

This lecture covers foundational topics from distributed computing, specifically:
- Client-server models
- Introduction to Node.js
- Event-driven programming
- Performance and reliability concerns in networked systems
- Comparative discussion of different distributed computing architectures

## 2. Client-Server Architecture

### Overview

A client-server model is a fundamental pattern in distributed systems where:

- A server hosts resources or services (e.g., databases)
- A client requests access to those services


### Client-Server Communication

- Runs on a network
- Typically modeled visually with clients and servers connected via a line or “cloud”
- The application logic is shared between client and server

### Server Responsibilities

- Maintains the authoritative "state of the system".
- Handles all significant data (e.g., enrollment records at a university).
- Enforces rules of the system (e.g., capacity limits).

### Client Responsibilities

- Sends requests to the server.
- Has little or no authoritative state information.
- Acts primarily as an interface or interaction mechanism.

### Real-world Example: Course Enrollment

- Students attempt to enroll in a class via a client (browser)
- The server determines whether a student is successfully enrolled
- Only servers possess the true, authoritative state

### Multiple Clients, Server Mediator Model

- Many clients can exist simultaneously
- Clients communicate only with the server, not directly with each other
- Race conditions can occur (e.g., two clients attempt to enroll at the same time)

Server resolves such conflicts by:
- Picking a winner
- Rejecting both (error)
- Or mistakenly accepting both (undesired)

## 3. Event-Driven Programming

### Definition

A different programming paradigm useful in environments where events happen spontaneously (like web servers).

### Asynchronous Events

- Events arrive from the external environment.
- May include:
  - Web requests.
  - Results from external databases.
  - File read completions.

> “Events arrive, and code is run in response.”

### Key Concepts

| Synchronous Program | Event-Driven Program |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| Linear execution    | Loops + Handlers     |
| Blocking I/O        | Non-blocking I/O     |

### The Event Loop 

A core concept underpinning environments like Node:

```javascript
while (true) {
  event = getNextEvent();
  handleEvent(event);
}
```

### Constraints of Event Handlers

- Should be FAST (e.g., microseconds to a few milliseconds)
- Avoid blocking functions (e.g., file.read(), network.read())

Blocking I/O causes:
- Delay in serving new requests
- Queued inputs
- Unresponsive systems

Example of bad event handler:
```javascript
function handleEvent() {
  const result = readBigFileSync(); // This blocks - BAD!
}
```

### Proper Strategy

- Split long tasks into short, fast handlers
- Schedule continuation via next event trigger

Example:

From:
```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
   doHeavyTask(i);
}
```

To:
```javascript
function doOne(i) {
   doHeavyTask(i);
   scheduleNext(() => doOne(i+1));
}
```

### Problems in Event-Driven Code

Potential Issues:
- Higher overhead per action.
- Error handling becomes complex.
- Loss of execution order.
- Difficult debugging and reasoning.

### Multi-threading vs Event-Driven

| Feature              | Event-Driven             | Multi-threading           |
|----------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| Concurrency Model     | Single-threaded, non-blocking | Multiple threads with context switching |
| Shared State         | No (single-thread = no races) | Yes (needs locks to avoid races) |
| Performance Potential| Limited CPU parallelism | High parallel performance |
| Safety               | No race conditions       | Race conditions possible |
| Complexity           | Moderate                 | High due to synchronization |

#### Key Benefit of Event-Driven

- No need for **locks**.
- Less prone to **race conditions**.

#### Limitations

- No true parallelism (one core at a time).
- If an event handler crashes or takes too long, the whole system halts.

## 4. Introduction to Node.js

### Overview

- JavaScript runtime for event-driven applications
- Runs JavaScript outside the browser (e.g., on servers)
- Allows asynchronous I/O using callbacks/event loop
- Built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine

### The Node Runtime

- Operates using the event loop.
- Non-blocking I/O.
- Built on the V8 JavaScript engine.

### JavaScript in Node

- Originally a browser language.
- Node allows JavaScript to run on servers (no GUI required).
- Async nature fits web servers well.

> “Node is for web servers that juggle many clients.”

## 5. Writing a Basic Node.js Web Server

### Source Code

```javascript
const http = require('http');
const ip = '127.0.0.1';
const port = 3000;

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.statusCode = 200;
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
  res.end('Hello CS35L World\n');
});

server.listen(port, ip, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://${ip}:${port}/`);
});
```

### Explanation

| Line | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| 1 | Load the HTTP module. |
| 2 | Set the local IP address. |
| 3 | Define the port number. |
| 5–9 | Set up request handler (callback). |
| 10–12 | Start the server and define startup callback. |

Special JS Feature:
```javascript
console.log(`Server running at http://${ip}:${port}/`);
```
- Example of a **template literal** (uses backticks ` `` `).
- Allows expression embedding: `${variable}`.

### Demo

- Run: `node app.js`
- Access: `http://localhost:3000`
- Response: “Hello World”

## 6. Distributed Computing Models

### 1. Client-Server Model

- Explained earlier.
- Centralized control and data.
- Problems:
  - Scalability.
  - Single point of failure.

### 2. Peer-to-Peer (P2P)

- Each peer has its own data and control.
- No centralized server.
- Pros:
  - Scalable.
  - Redundancy.
- Cons:
  - Complex consistency.
  - Data propagation challenges.

### 3. Primary-Secondary (Master-Worker)

- One **primary/master** controls the computation.
- Many **secondary/worker nodes** perform tasks.
- Used in:
  - ML Training.
  - Distributed DBs.

| Model | Use Case | Pros | Cons |
|-------|----------|------|------|
| Client-Server | Small to medium apps | Simple | Scalability |
| P2P | Decentralized systems | Scalable | Complexity |
| Master-Worker | Parallel computation | Control | Bottleneck at primary |

## 7. Distributed Systems Challenges

### A. Performance Problems

#### Throughput
- Number of operations per second
- Optimization methods:
  - Handle events out-of-order
  - Prioritize cached contents
  - Balance workload

#### Latency
- Time between request and response
- Optimization methods:
  - Cache on client
  - Use faster protocols
  - Reduce payload sizes

##### Latency Mitigation: Browser Cache Example

- Caches previously fetched results
- Avoids round trips to server

### B. Correctness Problems

#### Serialization

- Ensure multiple events result in consistent output
- Even if order of execution differs
- Software must be able to "simulate" serial logic

Example:

```
Requests A, B, C → Executed in order C, A, B
But result same as A, B, C → OK (Serializable)
```

#### Cache Staleness

- Client caches may become stale.
- Solutions:
  1. Validate cache by comparing server state identifier (UUID)
  2. Accept that cache is stale, if app can tolerate (e.g., video games)

| Condition                   | Strategy                    |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Cache critical              | Validate with server        |
| Cache negligible (e.g., news)| Ignore freshness slightly |

## 8. Deep Dive: Legacy Network Technology

### Circuit Switching Model

- Used in traditional (1960s–1980s) telephone systems.

Mechanism:
- A **dedicated communication path** is established for each call.

Strengths:
- Guaranteed bandwidth
- Efficient for long stable conversations

Problems:
- Inefficient
- Poor scalability
- Prone to failure if any intermediate node fails
- Motivated by Cold War defense needs

Diagram:

```
Phone A → Central Office → [Switch Network] → Central Office B → Phone B
```

## 9. Packet Switching (Modern Networks)

### Overview

The backbone of the modern Internet.

Mechanism:
- Data is split into **packets** (~1000 bytes).
- Each packet routes independently via routers.
  
Advantages:
- Resilient: if one node fails, packets find alternative routes.
- Efficient: no need to hold a full path open.
- Allows for re-routing around network failures

Key Terminology:

| Term     | Explanation                     |
|----------|---------------------------------|
| Packet   | A bundle of data (≤1500 bytes)  |
| Router   | Device routing packets          |
| IP       | Internet Protocol               |
| Hop      | Transition to next router       |

Routing independence: Each packet can take a different path, allowing flexible and dynamic routing.
