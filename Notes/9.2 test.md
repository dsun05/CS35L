# Lecture Notes on HTML, the DOM, CSS, JavaScript, JSX, and Python Dictionaries

## 1. HTML: Structure and Design Principles

### 1.1 Origins and Goals
- HTML is based on SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language).
- SGML goal: separation of content from form (presentation).
- HTML inherits the idea that:
  - **Content**: What the user wants to convey.
  - **Form**: How content is presented (appearance/style).
- HTML is declarative: it specifies desired output, not the steps required to achieve it.

### 1.2 Declarative vs. Imperative
- HTML: declarative (structure + content).
- JavaScript: imperative (logic + behavior).
- Goal: Use HTML as much as possible for structure and presentation.
- JavaScript is used when HTML/CSS can't sufficiently express desired behavior.
- This boundary is not always strict.

### 1.3 HTML Syntax and Elements

#### 1.3.1 HTML Elements
- Represent nodes in a tree structure.
- Use tags:
  ```html
  <tagname>Content here</tagname>
  ```
- The tree is kept in memory (DOM) by browsers and manipulated via JavaScript.

#### 1.3.2 Nesting and Valid Syntax
- Tags must be properly nested.
  - Invalid:
    ```html
    <a><b>…</a></b>
    ```
  - Valid:
    ```html
    <a><b>…</b></a>
    ```
- Mismatched or improperly nested tags typically render incorrectly, but browsers are forgiving.

#### 1.3.3 Optional and Void Tags
- Closing tags can sometimes be omitted if the structure is unambiguous.
- Void elements: represent standalone elements with no children.
  - Example:
    ```html
    <br>
    ```
  - Equivalent to:
    ```html
    <br></br>
    ```
    But HTML recommends using the shorter form.

### 1.4 Attributes
- Elements can have attributes: name-value pairs.
- Syntax:
  ```html
  <img width="1000">
  ```
- The attribute name and value are strings and must be unique per element.
- Attributes must appear in the opening tag.

### 1.5 Types of Elements
| Element Type | Characteristics                          | Example Tags       |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| Normal       | Can contain mixed content and children    | `<p>`, `<div>`     |
| Raw Text     | Can only contain text (rare)              | Could be `<script>`|
| Void         | Cannot have any content or children       | `<br>`, `<img>`    |

### 1.6 DTD and HTML Versions
- Early HTML specified strict rules using DTD (Document Type Declaration).
- DTD specifies:
  - Which elements are allowed.
  - Attributes for each element.
  - Allowed nesting/sub-elements.
- HTML 1–4 used this system.
- Issue: HTML evolved faster than standards.

### 1.7 HTML5 and Living Standards
- HTML5 abandoned rigid versioning.
- Specification now maintained online at w3.org.
- Living standard: constantly updated without version freezes.
- Practical and responsive to web development pace.

## 2. XML vs HTML

### 2.1 XML Overview
- XML = Extensible Markup Language.
- Similar to HTML but stricter syntax.
  - Closing tags are mandatory.
- Domain-specific extensions.
- XML is declarative and used in data-exchange scenarios.
- XHTML is XML-based HTML.

### 2.2 XML Use Cases
- Used in government and enterprise applications for structured data.
- Useful when correctness and validation are important (e.g., social security data).

### 2.3 XML vs HTML Syntax
| Feature           | HTML                    | XML                       |
|------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| Closing Tags      | Often optional          | Required                  |
| Error Tolerance   | Very forgiving          | Strict                    |
| Usage             | Web pages (UI)          | Structured data, APIs     |

## 3. DOM: Document Object Model

### 3.1 DOM Overview
- DOM: Tree of HTML content represented as objects.
- JavaScript accesses and manipulates this tree.

### 3.2 Operations with DOM
- Navigation: locate elements (`getElementById`, etc.).
- Traversal: visit nodes to search or extract data.
- Modification: change structure, add or remove elements.

### 3.3 DOM APIs
- Provided by browsers.
- Language-agnostic (usable beyond JavaScript).
- JavaScript is the dominant language using DOM today.

---

## 4. CSS: Cascading Style Sheets

### 4.1 Problem with Early HTML Styling
- Direct styling embedded in content:
  ```html
  <i>italics</i> <b>bold</b>
  ```
- Mixed content and presentation, making adaptation difficult.

### 4.2 Modern Semantic Styling
- Use semantic tags:
  ```html
  <em>emphasis</em> <strong>strong emphasis</strong>
  ```
- Use CSS to define presentation.
- Advantages:
  - Accessibility (e.g., screen readers).
  - Platform/device independence.

### 4.3 CSS Inheritance and Cascading
- Styles apply hierarchically.
- Stylesheets can originate from:
  - Browser defaults.
  - User preferences.
  - Author-defined styles.

### 4.4 CSS Syntax Example
```html
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Sample Text</span>
```
- Syntax:
  ```css
  property-name: value;
  ```

### 4.5 CSS Usage
- Designed for visual presentation (more design-focused).
- Collaboration between developers (logic) and designers (presentation).

## 5. JavaScript and JSX

### 5.1 JavaScript Basics
- Dynamic programming language.
- More dynamic than Python (e.g., runtime decisions).
- Used for interactiveness and logic in webpages.

### 5.2 Embedding JavaScript in HTML
```html
<script src="hello.js"></script>
```
- `<script>` is how HTML includes JavaScript.
- External scripts allow reuse and better modularity.
- JavaScript can also be embedded directly:
```html
<script>
  console.log("Hello, world!");
</script>
```

### 5.3 Reasons to Use External Scripts
- Modularity and code reuse.
- Easier updates.
- Support for 3rd-party libraries (no copy-and-paste).
- Better for copyright compliance.

## 6. JSX: JavaScript XML

### 6.1 What is JSX?
- A syntax extension to JavaScript used with React.
- Allows writing HTML-like code within JavaScript.

### 6.2 JSX Example
```jsx
const header = <h1 lang="en">CS35L Homework</h1>;
```
- Equivalent to multiple lines of JavaScript code creating DOM nodes, setting attributes, and inserting content.

### 6.3 JSX Embedding and Expressions
- Embed JavaScript into JSX using `{}`:
  ```jsx
  const course = "CS35L";
  const header = <h1>{course} Homework</h1>;
  ```

### 6.4 JSX Rendering
```jsx
ReactDOM.render(header, document.getElementById("root"));
```
- Attaches the JSX-generated element to the DOM.

## 7. JSON vs XML

### 7.1 JSON: JavaScript Object Notation
- Lightweight data-interchange format.
- Commonly used in web APIs and async data loading.
- Readable and writable directly in JavaScript.

### 7.2 JSON Example
```json
{
  "menu": {
    "id": "file",
    "value": "File",
    "popup": {
      "menuitem": [
        {"value": "New", "onclick": "CreateNewDoc()"},
        {"value": "Open", "onclick": "OpenDoc()"},
        {"value": "Close", "onclick": "CloseDoc()"}
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### 7.3 Comparison to XML

| Feature           | JSON                        | XML                         |
|------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|
| Syntax Simplicity | Simpler                     | Verbose                     |
| Readability       | Easier horizontally         | Harder                      |
| Data Orientation  | Keys on arcs                | Tags on elements (nodes)     |
| Parsability       | Built into JavaScript       | Requires external library    |

## 8. Browser Rendering Pipeline

### 8.1 Stages
1. Parse HTML → create DOM
2. Apply CSS → compute layout
3. Render → display pixels

### 8.2 Performance Practices
- Parsing, layout, and render can overlap for performance.
- Browsers render partially parsed HTML for responsiveness.

### 8.3 JavaScript and Rendering
- JavaScript execution may be delayed:
  - If DOM is not visible (e.g., below-the-fold elements).
  - If rendering is incomplete.
- JavaScript and rendering can interleave.
  - Can lead to race conditions if DOM is mutated before render.

### 8.4 Performance Tip
- Be careful where `<script>` tags are placed in HTML.
- Improper placement affects load speed and user experience.

## 9. Python: Dictionaries and Data Types

### 9.1 Python Mapping Types
- Most common: `dict`

### 9.2 Dictionaries Overview

#### Creation:
```python
d = {"a": 1, "b": 2}
```

#### Access:
```python
x = d["a"]
```

### 9.3 Key Characteristics
- Keys must be immutable.
- Values can be mutable or immutable.

### 9.4 Core Dictionary Operations

| Method                   | Description                          |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `len(d)`                 | Number of key-value pairs             |
| `d.clear()`              | Remove all pairs                      |
| `d.copy()`               | Shallow copy of dictionary            |
| `d.items()`              | View object of (key, value) tuples    |
| `d.keys()`               | View object of keys                   |
| `d.values()`             | View object of values                 |

### 9.5 Views and Mutability

- `.items()`, `.keys()`, & `.values()` return view objects:
  - Dynamic: reflect changes in dictionary.
  - Not independently mutable.

### 9.6 Copying vs Assignment

#### Assignment:
```python
e = d  # e refers to the same dict as d
```

#### Copy:
```python
e = d.copy()  # new dict, shared keys/values
```

### 9.7 Shallow vs Deep Copy
- `.copy()` is a shallow copy.
- Use `copy.deepcopy()` for recursive copy.

### 9.8 Dictionaries Are Ordered (Python 3.7+)
- Insertion order is preserved.
- Reassigning a key does not affect its position.
- Deleting and re-adding a key puts it at the end.

### 9.9 Iterating Over Dictionaries

#### Example:
```python
for key in d:
    print(key, d[key])
```

Or:
```python
for key, value in d.items():
    print(key, value)
```

## Summary

This lecture detailed the foundational concepts, history, and technical implementation of HTML, XML, the DOM, CSS, JavaScript, and related technologies. It explored declarative and imperative paradigms of web applications, described HTML syntax rules, different types of elements (void, raw, normal), and discussed the evolution from DTD-based HTML to HTML5’s living standard model. The lecture introduced the DOM as an object-oriented representation of HTML/XML trees, explained the role and application of cascading style sheets (CSS) to separate content from presentation, and covered JavaScript and JSX as mechanisms for imperative logic and efficient DOM manipulation. Lastly, it compared data-exchange formats XML and JSON, outlined the browser rendering pipeline for performance optimization, and provided a comprehensive overview of Python dictionaries, focusing on their operations, immutability, view objects, and performance characteristics.
