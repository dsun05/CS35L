# Git: Advanced Concepts and Internals

## 1. Rebasing in Git

### 1.1 Overview

Rebasing is the process of reapplying commits on top of another base tip. It's often used to clean up or reorder commits before publishing to a shared repository.

Rebasing is commonly used:
- To modify unpublished local commits
- To reorder commits for readability
- To delete or edit specific commits before sharing

### 1.2 Interactive Rebase (`git rebase -i`)

This command allows editing the commit history:

```bash
git rebase -i <commit-id>
```

- `-i`: Interactive mode
- `<commit-id>`: The commit before the first one you want to rebase

In the editor that opens:
- You can change the order of commits
- Delete commits
- Edit commits with the `edit` keyword

#### Example

```text
pick abcd123 Add logging
pick efgh456 Fix bug
pick xyzw789 Update Makefile
```

We can reorder or transform into:

```text
pick efgh456 Fix bug
edit abcd123 Add logging
drop xyzw789 Update Makefile
```

To continue:

```bash
git rebase --continue
```

If conflicts arise:
- Fix the conflict
- `git add` to stage the resolved files
- Continue with `git rebase --continue`

Use `git status` to see the current status of the rebase.

### 1.3 Merge Conflicts During Rebase

Changing the order of commits may lead to merge conflicts. Resolve them manually, stage the resolutions, and continue the rebase process.

## 2. Remote Repositories

### 2.1 Git as a Distributed VCS

Key characteristics:
- Multiple repositories exist without a required central authority
- Useful for decentralized collaboration

Each local repository can:
- Push to known remotes
- Fetch or pull from others

### 2.2 Viewing and Managing Remotes

- `git remote`: List all remotes
- `git remote -v`: List remotes with fetch and push URLs

### 2.3 Origin Convention

When cloning from a remote like GitHub:
- The default remote is named `origin`

You can change/add remotes with:
```bash
git remote add <name> <url>
git remote set-url <name> <new-url>
```

### 2.4 Fetch vs Pull

| Command     | Behavior                                         |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `git fetch` | Fetch changes from remote without merging        |
| `git pull`  | Fetch + Merge (potentially causing merge conflicts) |

Considerations:
- `pull` can create merge commits
- Developers preferring a clean history often use fetch + rebase

### 2.5 Tracking Branches

Tracking allows local branches to stay in sync with their remote counterparts.

```bash
git branch --track <branch> origin/<branch>
```

- Links local and remote branches
- Enables default behavior for `git pull` on that branch

## 3. Stashing

### 3.1 What is Stashing?

Temporarily saves work-in-progress changes when you're not ready to commit them.

Commands:

- `git stash push`: Save current uncommitted changes
- `git stash apply`: Reapply the last saved stashed changes
- `git stash list`: View stashed entries
- `git stash show`: View contents of the top stash
- `git stash drop`: Remove a stash entry
- `git stash pop`: Apply and remove the top stash

Alternative manual stashing:

```bash
git diff > patch.diff
git checkout branch
# Later
patch -p1 < patch.diff
```

Used to prevent committing broken code or switching to another context (e.g., critical bugfixes).

---

## 4. Bisecting: Finding Bug Introductions

### 4.1 Git Bisect

Useful when a bug is introduced between two known good/bad states.

Commands:

```bash
git bisect start
git bisect bad           # current or specified bad commit
git bisect good <commit> # known good commit
git bisect run <script>  # automates bisection
```

Example:

```bash
git bisect start
git bisect bad
git bisect good v23
git bisect run make check
```

Runs a binary search to find the first bad commit (log₂N complexity).

### 4.2 Skipping Commits

If a commit can't be tested (e.g., doesn't build):

```bash
git bisect skip <commit>
```

Enables smoother bisection process even with non-functional commits.

## 5. Git Internals

### 5.1 `.git/` Directory Structure

| Path                | Description                                                    |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `config`            | Project-specific Git configuration                            |
| `head`              | Points to the current branch or commit                        |
| `hooks/`            | Scripts triggered by Git events (e.g., `pre-commit`)          |
| `info/exclude`      | Ignore rules not under version control                        |
| `logs/`             | History of branch/HEAD move events                            |
| `objects/`          | Storage for all Git objects (blobs, trees, commits)           |
| `refs/`             | Human-readable names (branches, tags) mapped to SHA1          |
| `index`             | Staging area between working directory and the repository     |

### 5.2 Object Database

Git stores files as objects:

#### Object Types

| Type    | Description                                           |
|---------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| blob    | File content                                           |
| tree    | Directory structure (refers to blobs/trees)           |
| commit  | Snapshot metadata + reference to root tree            |

#### Object Storage

- Objects are stored as compressed binary files in `.git/objects/` using SHA1 filenames.

Example file path:
```
.git/objects/3f/c1432... (total 40 hex chars split into directories)
```

Early versions used flat storage, which caused performance issues. Git introduced a subdirectory partitioning scheme to mitigate this.

### 5.3 View Object Contents

- Get type:
```bash
git cat-file -t <sha>
```

- Get content:
```bash
git cat-file -p <sha>
```

- Create object:
```bash
echo "hello" | git hash-object -w --stdin
```

#### Example Usage

Create a blob:

```bash
echo "Arma virumque cano" > aeneid.txt
git hash-object -w aeneid.txt
```

### 5.4 Trees

Trees represent directory structure.

Each tree entry contains:
| Component | Purpose                                |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------|
| Name      | Filename or subdirectory                |
| Type      | `blob` or `tree`                        |
| Mode      | File permissions (e.g., 100644, 040000) |
| SHA1      | Points to blob or subtree               |

Use:

```bash
git update-index --add --cacheinfo 100644 <blob-sha> filename.txt
git write-tree
```

Resulting SHA is a tree object.

### 5.5 Commits

A commit links a tree and metadata about the snapshot.

Contents of a commit:

```
tree <tree-sha>
parent <parent-commit-sha>
author <name> <email> <timestamp>
committer <name> <email> <timestamp>

<commit message>
```

Create manually:

```bash
git commit-tree <tree-sha> -m "message"
```

Result: New commit SHA printed to stdout.

## 6. Git Plumbing vs Porcelain

| Category  | Description                                     | Examples                       |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Porcelain | User-facing commands for day-to-day use         | `git add`, `git commit`, `git push` |
| Plumbing  | Low-level commands for scripting or development | `git hash-object`, `git cat-file`, `git write-tree` |

Use plumbing commands when building custom tools or debugging repository state.

## Summary

This lecture provided an in-depth exploration of advanced Git features and internals. Key topics included interactive rebasing, enabling developers to reorder and edit commits before publishing; distributed nature of Git with remotes, remapping strategies, and synchronization via `fetch` and `pull`; stashing for temporarily saving changes; bisecting to efficiently track down regressions; and a tour through the internal structure and types within the `.git/` directory. It further introduced Git's core concept of representing file changes as a graph of SHA1-addressed objects, and distinguished between the user-facing "porcelain" commands and low-level "plumbing" commands that interact directly with Git’s object database.
