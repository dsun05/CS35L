## 1. Overview

This lecture presents a deep dive into three essential components of software systems:
- Emacs as a programmable IDE
- Linux file system concepts
- Basic shell commands and their interaction with the file system

The lecture merges theory with experiential learning, mimicking how technologies are introduced in the real world — collectively and interactively.

## 2. Emacs as an IDE

### History and Purpose

- Initially, the instructor used Vim (and VI), but switched to Emacs due to its programmability.
- Emacs embeds a programming language (Emacs Lisp) which allows developers to build IDE-like tooling and systems efficiently.
- Emacs is programmable, extensible, and scriptable, making it suitable for heavy development work.

### Emacs Features

Emacs is known for:
- Deep programmability
- Visual frame and window system
- Modality through Modes
- Internal shell invocation
- Editing many kinds of resources (e.g., files, directories, buffers)

### Buffers vs. Files

- **Buffer**: A temporary in-memory representation of data (text, code, etc.)
- **File**: Stored on disk, persistent across system reboots.
  
Emacs distinguishes between these:
- Opening a file loads it into a buffer
- Changes are made to the buffer, not directly to the file
- Save operation (Ctrl-X Ctrl-S) writes buffer content to the file

Use case:
```bash
Ctrl-X Ctrl-F hello.txt       # Open or create file in buffer
Editing in buffer             # Does not affect file
Ctrl-X Ctrl-S                 # Save buffer to file
```

### File Persistence in Emacs

Persistence in terms of application design means data survives crashes or reboots. Emacs approaches this with:

1. Buffers (fast, temporary)
2. Auto-save files (e.g., #hello.txt#)
3. Backup symbolic link to track editing (e.g., .#hello.txt)

Problems with persistent variables:
- Naive persistent variables (e.g., writing directly to storage each change) can degrade performance due to I/O latency.

Table: File Save Lifecycle in Emacs

| Stage              | Description                                            |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Start editing      | Buffer is in memory, file untouched                   |
| Auto-save (periodic) | Saves to a temp file (#hello.txt#)                  |
| File lock (symbolic link) | Symbolic link to editing session metadata (e.g., .#hello.txt) |
| Manual Save (Ctrl-X Ctrl-S) | Writes buffer to hello.txt                   |

### Emacs Modes

- Emacs is a "modeful" editor
- A mode is a set of behaviors/rules for how keypresses and commands are interpreted
- Examples:
  - Text Mode
  - Dired Mode (directory editing)
  
Modes affect behavior:
- Typing `d` in a buffer inserts "d"
- Typing `d` in Dired marks file for deletion

List of Emacs Commands (selected):

| Command         | Meaning                                              |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Ctrl-X Ctrl-F   | Find (open) file                                      |
| Ctrl-X Ctrl-S   | Save buffer contents to file                          |
| Ctrl-X 4 D      | Open directory editor in new window                   |
| Ctrl-X O        | Switch window (focus)                                 |
| Ctrl-S          | Forward search                                       |
| Ctrl-R          | Reverse search                                       |
| Ctrl-@ (Ctrl-Space) | Set mark for region                              |
| Meta-W          | Copy region                                          |
| Ctrl-Y          | Paste (Yank)                                         |
| Ctrl-G          | Abort current command (interrupt)                    |
| Ctrl-X 1        | Maximize current window                              |
| Meta-X shell    | Start a shell inside Emacs                           |

### Windows and Frames

Terminology:

| Emacs Term | Traditional GUI Analog      |
|------------|-----------------------------|
| Window     | Portion of a single frame   |
| Frame      | What others call "window"   |

- Multiple Emacs "windows" split a "frame"
- Commands like `Ctrl-X 4 D` open Dired in separate window

### Emacs Editor for Directories (Dired Mode)

Dired is a mode for editing and navigating directories:

- Textual view of directory contents
- Limited editing (e.g., flagging for deletion)
- Drive changes back to the filesystem

Table: Dired Commands

| Key         | Action                         |
|-------------|--------------------------------|
| d           | Mark file for deletion         |
| x           | Execute marked delete actions  |
| u           | Unmark                         |

## 3. Linux File System Concepts

### Files and File Types

In Linux:

- Files are objects storing a finite sequence of bytes
- Associated with metadata (permissions, size, timestamps)
- Common types:
  - - : Regular File
  - d : Directory
  - l : Symbolic Link

### File Metadata (shown with `ls -l`)

Example:
```
-rwxr-xr-- 1 egert egert 1234 Apr 5 10:00 hello.txt
```

Breakdown:
| Component     | Meaning                          |
|---------------|----------------------------------|
| -rwxr-xr--     | Permissions (user/group/other) |
| 1              | Link count                      |
| egert egert    | Owner and Group                 |
| 1234           | Size in bytes                   |
| Apr 5 10:00    | Last modified time              |
| hello.txt      | File name                       |

Table: Permission Bits

| Section | Symbol | Octal | Role                  |
|---------|--------|-------|------------------------|
| User    | rwx    | 7     | Owner permissions      |
| Group   | r-x    | 5     | Group permissions      |
| Other   | r--    | 4     | Others' permissions    |

Common Permission Formats:

| Symbolic | Octal | Meaning                          |
|----------|--------|----------------------------------|
| rwxr--r-- | 744  | Owner can read/write/execute     |
| rw-r--r-- | 644  | Owner can read/write, others read |
| rwxrwxr-x | 775  | Group shares full rights          |

### Special Permission Bits

Linux includes 12 permission bits:
- 9 common bits (3x rwx for user/group/others)
- 3 special bits:

| Name     | Symbol | Effect                                           |
|----------|--------|--------------------------------------------------|
| setuid   | s      | Run file as file's owner                         |
| setgid   | s      | Run as file's group                              |
| sticky   | t      | Applies to directories — restricts deletion      |

Example:
```
-rwsr-xr-- 1 root root 1234 su       # setuid (run as root)
drwxrwxrwt 10 root root 4096 /tmp   # sticky bit (shared dir)
```

### Symbolic and Hard Links

- Symbolic Links:
  - Point to a path
  - Created with: `ln -s target linkname`
  - Can be "dangling" (point to non-existent file)
  
- Hard Links:
  - Share inode (data) and increase link count
  - Created with: `ln file1 file2`
  - Both names refer to the same data

Hard Link Example:
```bash
touch foo
ln foo bar        # bar is another name for foo
```

Inode Confirmation with `ls -i`:
```
123456 foo
123456 bar       # same inode = same file
```

Use `rm` to remove a name; file persists until all links are removed.

### Directories

- Directories are files that map names to inodes
- Always contain `.` (self) and `..` (parent)
- Link count of directory:
  - Starts at 2 (for `.` and parent `..`)
  - Adds 1 for each subdirectory

```bash
mkdir dir
ls -ld dir        # shows link count 2
mkdir dir/subdir
ls -ld dir        # link count now 3
```

### Tree-Structured File System

- Root directory: `/`
- Files organized in hierarchy beneath root
- Paths:
  - Absolute: `/home/user/file.txt`
  - Relative: `./file.txt` or `../file.txt`

Diagram:

```
/
├── home/
│   └── egert/
│       ├── foo
│       └── bar
├── usr/
│   └── bin/
└── tmp/

```

### Inode Numbers

- Every file has a unique inode number
- Use `ls -i` to view
- Link count: Number of names pointing to an inode

## 4. Shell Commands and Utilities

These utilities interact with the file system and processes.

### Basic Shell Overview

- Provides interface between user and OS
- Setting: Emacs can embed shell as buffer (`M-x shell`)

### cat

- Stands for "concatenate"
- Reads files and writes to standard output

Examples:
```bash
cat file1             # Print content
cat file1 file2       # Concatenate and print
```

Special behavior:
- `cat` with no arguments reads from terminal (stdin)
- Ctrl+D at start of line signals EOF

### ps

- Shows process status
- `ps -ef`: Lists all processes with full info

Sample Output:
```
UID   PID   PPID  CMD
egert 22588 1     emacs
```

Process ID (PID) used in Emacs symbolic links:
```
.#hello.txt -> egert@machine.22588:timestamp
```

### chmod

- Changes file permissions
- Syntax:
  ```bash
  chmod 644 file.txt
  chmod +x script.sh
  ```

### ln

Creates links:
- `ln file1 file2`: Hard link
- `ln -s path link`: Symbolic link

Special cases:
- Cannot hard-link directories (except by filesystem convention for `.` and `..`)
- Emacs uses symbolic links to indicate lock/status metadata for edited files

### touch, rm, and truncate

- `touch`: Creates empty file or updates timestamp
- `rm`: Removes file name (not file unless final link)
- `truncate`: Sets file size without writing content

Example:
```bash
truncate -s 1T bigfile   # Create 1 terabyte sparse file
ls -lh bigfile           # Shows size
cat bigfile              # Outputs null bytes (if not crashed)
```

## 5. Summary

This lecture presented a practical and theoretical overview of three interrelated software systems:

- Emacs serves as a versatile and programmable IDE, allowing buffer-based editing, multiple modes, and integration with shell utilities. Emphasis was placed on understanding persistence, buffer and file distinctions, and Emacs' conventions for auto-save and editing metadata.

- The Linux File System was dissected to reveal keys to its design — file types, permissions, link counts, inodes, and directory hierarchies. Core ideas included symbolic vs. hard links, metadata interpretation, and tree-based storage structures.

- Shell utilities like cat, ps, chmod, ln, truncate and others were examined in their role interacting with file structures and facilitating file or process management.

Together, these systems exemplify a Unix philosophy of modular, transparent, and user-powered computing.
