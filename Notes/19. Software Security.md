# 1. Introduction to Software Security

## 1.1. Security as a Priority

- Security must be considered from the very beginning of software design.
- It should be integrated into initial specs, requirements, and all stages of development.
- A common myth is that you can "add security later"—this usually leads to insecure architectures that are difficult to fix.
- Developers are responsible for building secure systems; clients assume developers understand security.
- Ignoring security wastes time and resources and may lead to serious vulnerabilities.

## 1.2. Importance of Security as a Field

- Computer security is a major field in practical applications (e.g., jobs, internships).
- It is one of the largest areas next to artificial intelligence.
- Even non-security-focused developers should understand the basics to communicate with specialists and avoid critical mistakes.

# 2. Foundations of Secure Design

## 2.1. Step Zero: Define a Security Mindset

Before tackling security, two essential models need to be developed:

### 2.1.1. Security Model

- A representation of what the application is defending (the assets).
- Defines "crown jewels" or valuable data (e.g., user information, credentials).
- Often based on the **CIA Triad**:
  - **Confidentiality (Privacy):** Preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data.
  - **Integrity:** Preventing unauthorized modification or tampering of data.
  - **Availability (Service):** Ensuring systems are usable and accessible.

### 2.1.2. Threat Model

- Identifies who might attack the system and how.
- Helps prioritize defense strategies and focus on realistic threats.
- Models are never perfect, but should be continuously improved.

### Suggested Checklist for Security Modeling

| Category       | Purpose                                                | Example                                                                 |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Assets         | Identify what needs protection                          | Database contents, configuration files, credentials                    |
| Vulnerabilities| Weak channels attackers can exploit                     | Open ports, input validation flaws, misconfigurations                  |
| Threats        | Potential bad actors or scenarios related to environment| Former employees, bots, phishing attempts                              |

# 3. Key Security Functions

## 3.1. Authentication

- Verifies user identity.
- Examples include:
  - Passwords (e.g., username + password).
  - Two-factor authentication (2FA): Password + device/key.
    - Devices can include apps (Duo), USB keys, or biometrics (e.g., retinal scans).
    - Example: Duo security app or TOTP tokens.

### MFA Categories

| Method Type         | Description                          | Example                          |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Something you know  | Knowledge-based                      | Password, PIN                    |
| Something you have  | Possession-based                     | USB key, Duo app, TOTP device    |
| Something you are   | Inherent/biometric                   | Fingerprint, retinal scan        |

## 3.2. Authorization

- Dictates what authenticated users can do.
- Example: Instructor can modify grades in their own classes, but not others.
- Uses Access Control Lists (ACLs):

### Example ACL Table

| User      | Read | Write | Execute |
|-----------|------|-------|---------|
| Eggert    | Yes  | Yes   | Yes     |
| Milstein  | Yes  | No    | No      |
| Frank     | No   | No    | No      |

## 3.3. Integrity Mechanisms

Ensure detection and recovery from unauthorized changes.

| Mechanism     | Description                                  |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Checksums     | Value calculated from data; used to detect tampering |
| Backups       | Regular data snapshots in secure locations   |

## 3.4. Auditing

- Logs user actions to help detect or recover from intrusions.
- Logs should be secure, complete, and reviewed regularly.

## 3.5. Supporting Principles

| Principle     | Description                                                               |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Correctness   | Secure features must not interfere with core functionality                |
| Efficiency    | Security must not overly degrade system or human performance              |

# 6. Security Testing

## 6.1. Testing Philosophy

| Traditional Testing              | Security Testing                        |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Inputs modeled like typical users| Assume inputs from malicious attackers  |
| Failures are random              | Failures are deliberate and targeted     |
| Bugs accidental                  | Bugs exploited systematically            |

## 6.2. Strategies

### 6.2.1. Static Analysis

- Analyze code without executing it.
- Can catch buffer overflows, uninitialized variables, or data races.
- Highly recommended for secure development.

### 6.2.2. Penetration Testing

- Hiring trusted "black hats" to attempt to break into your system.
- Simulates a real-world attack scenario.

## 6.3. Side-Channel and Timing Attacks

Attackers infer internal state or data via:

| Method           | Description                                                                          |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Cache Timing     | Measuring time differences in accessing memory (e.g., Spectre, Meltdown)            |
| Resolution Restriction | Apple restricts access to high-resolution timers to inhibit timing attacks         |

## 6.4. Subtle Abstraction Violations

- Example: Checking execution time of partial string comparison to reveal password one byte at a time.
- Advanced techniques involve manipulating memory layout, exploiting page boundaries, or cache access patterns.

# 7. Trusting Trust: Ken Thompson’s Attack

## 7.1. The Concept

- Described in a famous Turing Award lecture.
- Modify a C compiler (`cc`) to insert a backdoor conditionally when compiling:

Example:

```c
if (strcmp(name, "ken") == 0) return true;
```

Then compile login.c using the backdoored `cc`.

## 7.2. Deeper Attack

- Also modifies `cc` to insert the backdoor into any subsequent versions of `cc`.
- Result: Even if login.c and `cc.c` (source code) are inspected, the executables will regenerate the backdoor.

## 7.3. Defense

- The concept of a **Trusted Computing Base (TCB)**:
  - A minimal set of components (e.g., compiler, OS, hardware) must be explicitly trusted.
- Software reproducibility and rigorous reviews can reduce risk but ultimate trust must start somewhere.

# 8. Summary

This lecture covered the foundational principles and practical realities of software security. It emphasized the importance of integrating security into the earliest stages of design, not as an afterthought. Key models such as the security model (what to protect) and the threat model (who and what you’re defending against) provide a framework for prioritizing defense mechanisms.

The CIA Triad of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability was presented as a core set of objectives. Complementary to these are the necessary functional pillars like authentication, authorization, integrity checking, and auditing.

Diverse threats ranging from network and device attacks to social engineering and insider risks were discussed, along with defense strategies and real-world examples. The lecture also reviewed the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities to highlight common application-level security risks.

Testing in a security context was shown to differ substantially from traditional methods—expecting and simulating intelligent adversaries, not just random bugs. Advanced attacks like cache timing exploits (Spectre, Meltdown) and Ken Thompson’s self-replicating compiler backdoor were presented to illustrate the deep layers possible in security compromise.

Students are encouraged to think like defenders—and sometimes like attackers—to better understand, prevent, and mitigate risks in their software.
