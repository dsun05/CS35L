# 1. Software Build Automation

## 1.1 Manual Build Process
- In earlier stages, building software was done manually.
  - Developers compiled source code by hand.
  - Steps included writing code, compiling it manually using command-line tools like `gcc`, and running it.
- In educational courses like CS31 and CS32, students are expected to manually manage these steps.

## 1.2 Automation via Scripts
- To automate repetitive tasks, developers typically write shell scripts or Python scripts.
  - These scripts contain hard-coded commands to compile and link code.
  - Example:
    ```bash
    #!/bin/sh
    gcc -c foo1.c
    gcc -c foo2.c
    gcc -c foo3.c
    echo $1 > foo4.c
    gcc -c foo4.c
    gcc foo1.o foo2.o foo3.o foo4.o -o myprogram
    ```
  - While functional, this approach is inefficient and error-prone.

## 1.3 Problems with Naive Automation
- Inefficiencies:
  - Running the same build script after small changes recompiles everything unnecessarily.
- Redundant Work:
  - Even if only `foo1.c` changed, `foo2.c`, `foo3.c`, and the link step are still redundantly rerun.
- Ideal: Incremental rebuilds that only perform necessary actions.

## 1.4 Solution: Using `make`

### 1.4.1 What is `make`?
- A tool that automates builds and avoids unnecessary work.
- Input: A file named `Makefile`.
- Uses file timestamps to determine which pieces need to be rebuilt.

### 1.4.2 Structure of a `Makefile`
Makefiles consist of rules with the format:
```makefile
target: dependencies
    command-to-build-target
```

### 1.4.3 Example
```makefile
myprogram: foo1.o foo2.o foo3.o foo4.o
    gcc foo1.o foo2.o foo3.o foo4.o -o myprogram

foo1.o: foo1.c
    gcc -c foo1.c

foo2.o: foo2.c bar.h
    gcc -c foo2.c

foo3.o: foo3.c
    gcc -c foo3.c

foo4.c:
    echo $1 > foo4.c

foo4.o: foo4.c
    gcc -c foo4.c
```

### 1.4.4 How `make` Optimizes
- Dependencies' timestamps are compared with associated targets.
- If the target is newer than all dependencies, it's considered up-to-date.
- Only outdated targets are rebuilt.

### 1.4.5 Issues and Improvements
- Dependency omission:
  - If a file `foo1.c` includes `bar.h` but the Makefile omits this, changes to `bar.h` won't trigger rebuilds.
- Over-specification:
  - Adding unnecessary dependencies increases build time but ensures correctness.
- Solution:
  - Use compilers like GCC/Clang to auto-generate dependencies with flags like `-MMD`.

### 1.4.6 Clock Skew
- Compilation timestamps can be messed up on distributed systems with inconsistent clocks.
- May cause:
  - Unnecessary rebuilds.
  - Skipped builds (dangerous).
- Alternative solution:
  - Use file checksums instead of timestamps (more management overhead required).

### 1.4.7 Parallel Builds
- `make -j` enables parallel execution of independent build steps.
- Example: GNU make with `-j96` parallelizes builds on machines with many cores.

### 1.4.8 Managing Large Builds
- Avoid large monolithic Makefiles.
- Two approaches:

#### Approach 1: Recursive `make`
```makefile
cd subdir && make
```
- Separate Makefiles per subdirectory.
- Difficult to parallelize due to isolated `make` processes.

#### Approach 2: Single Top-level Makefile + Includes
```makefile
include src/module1/Makefile
include src/module2/Makefile
```
- Centralized control for better dependency-management and effective parallelism.

# 2. Portability and System Configuration

## 2.1 Problem: OS-Specific Features
- Not all platforms support the same system calls.
- Example: `renameat2()` is available in Linux but not in Windows.

## 2.2 Conditional Compilation
- Use C preprocessor to select different implementations.
  ```c
  #ifdef __linux__
      // Use renameat2
  #else
      // Use fallback logic
  #endif
  ```

## 2.3 Preferred: Feature Testing
- Rather than test OS name, check if a feature is available.
- Requires:
  - Probing the target system during the build process.

## 2.4 Build-Time Configuration via Generated Headers
- Write a test program that attempts to use the feature.
- Generate a configuration header (`config.h`)
  ```c
  #define HAS_RENAMEAT2 1
  ```

### 2.4.1 Automation Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `configure` | Probes system for available features and generates `config.h` |
| `autoconf` | Generates the `configure` script |
| `automake` | Generates portable `Makefile`s |

- These tools represent layers of meta-programming and automation.

# 3. Packaging for Higher-Level Languages

## 3.1 Packaging in Python (Example)
- Uses `pyproject.toml` as the metadata and build configuration.

### Example `pyproject.toml`:
```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools >= 77.0"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"

[project]
name = "myproject"
version = "1.0.0"
authors = [{ name = "Your Name", email = "you@example.com" }]
license = "GPL-3.0"
```

## 3.2 Warnings
- Do not underestimate configuration files.
- Faulty build metadata leads to failed installs and broken compatibility.

# 4. Databases

## 4.1 Motivation
- File systems are unstructured.
- Databases offer:
  - Structured access.
  - Guaranteed consistency.
  - Efficient search.
  - Concurrency-safe access and modification.

## 4.2 Relational Database Model

### 4.2.1 Data Model
- Data stored in tables (relations) with rows and columns.

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Table | A collection of rows; flat schema |
| Row | A single record (entity) |
| Column | A typed field across all rows |
| Key | Column/set of columns uniquely identifying rows |
| Primary Key | Uniquely identifies a row |
| Foreign Key | References a key in another table |

### 4.2.2 Column Properties
- Fixed data types (e.g. `INT`, `VARCHAR(255)`)
- Some databases support `NULL` to represent missing/unknown data.
- NULL introduces three-valued logic (TRUE, FALSE, UNKNOWN), which complicates query logic.

## 4.3 SQL (Structured Query Language)

### 4.3.1 Define Schema
Example: Create Students and Classes
```sql
CREATE TABLE student (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    family_name VARCHAR(255),
    given_names VARCHAR(255),
    major VARCHAR(64)
);

CREATE TABLE class (
    student_id INT,
    letter_grade VARCHAR(2),
    FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES student(id)
);
```

### 4.3.2 Inserting Data
```sql
INSERT INTO student VALUES (1, 'Abdul-Jabbar', 'Kareem', 'Sociology');
INSERT INTO student VALUES (2, 'Coppola', 'Francis', 'Film Studies');
```

### 4.3.3 Query
```sql
SELECT id, major FROM student
ORDER BY major ASC;
```

## 4.4 Relational Algebra

### Operators

| Operation | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Selection | Select rows based on predicates (e.g. major = 'CS') |
| Projection | Select columns, remove duplicates |
| Union | Combine two tables with same schema |
| Intersection | Return shared rows from both tables |
| Cartesian Product | Combine every row of one table with each row of another |
| Join | Combine rows from two tables based on common attributes |

### Join Example

Tables:

**student**

| id | major      |
|----|------------|
| 1  | CS         |
| 2  | CE         |

**class**

| student_id | class   |
|------------|---------|
| 1          | Senior  |
| 2          | Junior  |

Join:
```sql
SELECT s.id, s.major, c.class
FROM student s JOIN class c ON s.id = c.student_id;
```

Result:

| id | major | class  |
|----|-------|--------|
| 1  | CS    | Senior |
| 2  | CE    | Junior |

## 4.5 Alternate Database Models

### 4.5.1 Entity-Relationship (ER) Model
- Defines data as:
  - Entities (objects with identity)
  - Attributes (object properties)
  - Relationships (references between entities)

### 4.5.2 Object-Oriented Databases
- Data modeled as objects including:
  - Attributes
  - Methods (class-specific logic)
  - Class hierarchy (like in Java/C++)

### 4.5.3 NoSQL
- Rejects rigid table format of relational models.
- Often used in:
  - Web apps
  - Unstructured or semi-structured data
- Key-value stores:
  - Hash table-like structures
  - Wide-column: Columns can differ between rows

### 4.5.4 Graph Databases
- Nodes represent entities.
- Edges express relationships.

### 4.5.5 Document Stores
- Store complete objects/documents: JSON, XML, etc.

| Model | Benefits | Trade-offs |
|-------|----------|------------|
| Relational | Strong structure, proven | Rigid schema |
| NoSQL | Flexibility, scalable | May lack strong guarantees |

## 4.6 ACID Properties

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Atomicity | Transactions are all-or-nothing |
| Consistency | DB always satisfies constraints/invariants |
| Isolation | Concurrent operations don't interfere |
| Durability | Changes persist across failures |

### Example
```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
INSERT INTO student VALUES (...);
UPDATE classes SET grade='A' WHERE ...;
COMMIT;
```
- Without atomicity, parts may apply if system crashes.
- Without isolation, two users may see inconsistent data.

## 4.7 Compromising ACID
- Many cloud/NoSQL databases sacrifice consistency or isolation for scalability (eventual consistency).
- Developers must balance speed, complexity, and correctness.

## 4.8 Practical Tools
- Firebase: Popular NoSQL backend
  - Not designed for full ACID compliance
  - Emphasizes synchronization across clients
- Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL: Relational, support full ACID

# Summary

This lecture explored the processes involved in software build automation, emphasizing the shift from manual scripting to sophisticated tools like `make` and `autoconf`, which support partial builds, parallelism, and build portability. It introduced the relational model of databases, describing tables, keys, and relational algebra operations like selection, projection, and join. The SQL language was presented as the interface for querying and modifying data in relational databases. Alternative data models, including the ER model, object-oriented databases, NoSQL systems, and graph/document stores, were introduced to highlight flexibility and trade-offs in modern data systems. Finally, ACID propertiesâ€”atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durabilityâ€”were defined as critical reliability guarantees for transactional databases. These foundational principles are essential for constructing robust, scalable software systems.
