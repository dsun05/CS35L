# Introduction to GDB

## 1. Debugging in GDB

### 1.1 Introductory Discussion
- Discussion on whether live demonstrations of debugging tools (like GDB) should be included in lectures.
- Pros of demos:
  - Shows real-time problem-solving.
  - Demonstrates how functions behave in practice.
- Cons:
  - Demos take more time and might cover fewer topics.
  - Risk of being dull if not executed well.

---

### 1.2 GDB Essentials

#### 1.2.1 Stack-Related Commands
| Command | Full Form | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| `i f`  | `info frame` | Shows information about the current function stack frame. |
| `bt` or `i s` | `backtrace` or `info stack` | Lists call stack trace, showing how program arrived at current function. |

- Stack frames record what function called what.
- Optimizations at machine level may cause missing frames in the trace. E.g., tail-call optimization can collapse function calls.
- Local variables may be optimized out and hence unavailable in GDB.

#### 1.2.2 Conditional Breakpoints
```gdb
b sqrt
condition 27 x < 0
```
- Stops only when a condition is met (e.g., sqrt is called with a negative number).
- Prevents hitting breakpoints unnecessarily.

#### 1.2.3 Advanced Expression Evaluation
- `print expr`: Standard way to evaluate an expression.
- `display expr`: More detailed; can print each step of evaluation.
- GDB allows tooling with Python to customize how structures (like graphs) are displayed.

#### 1.2.4 Register Inspection
```gdb
i r
p $xmm0
```
- `info registers`: Shows machine register values.
- Useful for performance checks and low-level debugging.

---

### 1.3 Remote and Cross-Platform Debugging

#### 1.3.1 Debugging Different Architectures
```gdb
target architecture-name
```
- Allows debugging code meant for different architectures (e.g., ARM, x86-64).

#### 1.3.2 Remote Debugging
- GDB can debug programs running on remote machines via serial ports or network (TCP/IP).
- Useful for embedded systems or IoT devices lacking GDB capabilities natively.

---

### 1.4 GDB Macros and Extensions

#### 1.4.1 GDB Macros
```gdb
define printlook
  print *(long*)0xAAFC08
end
```
- Custom debugging commands.
- $arg1, $arg2, etc., can be used for parameter substitution.

#### 1.4.2 Extension Languages
- GDB supports:
  - Its own macro language.
  - Python (powerful and common).
  - Lisp (from Emacs heritage).

---

### 1.5 Alternative Debugging Strategies

#### 1.5.1 Assertions
C-style:
```c
assert(x >= 0);
```

- If `x < 0`, the program prints error and aborts.
- Can be compiled away using `-DNDEBUG`.

| Advantage | Disadvantage |
|---------|--------------|
| Helps catch bugs early | Assertions with side effects behave unpredictably if compiled out |

#### 1.5.2 Exception Handling
Python-style:
```python
try:
    do_something()
except ZeroDivisionError:
    handle_issue()
```

Alternative C-style:
```c
if (do_something() < 0) {
    handle_issue();
}
```

| Feature | Try-Catch | Manual Checking |
|---------|----------|-----------------|
| Clearer mainline code | Yes | No |
| Easier to track flow | No | Yes |

#### 1.5.3 Logging and Tracing
- Print/log statements to track execution.
- Logs: Explicit in code.
- Traces: Generated by external tools (e.g., strace for Linux).

#### 1.5.4 Checkpoint-Restart
- Save application state at intervals.
- On crash, reload checkpoint to reproduce or recover state.

#### 1.5.5 Barricades
- Architecture for legacy modernization.
- Build a clean subsystem separated by a “barricade”.
- Only allow access via validated interfaces.

Versioned cleanup pattern:
1. Start with this structure:
```
[Messy Code] --barricade--> [Clean Code]
```
2. Gradually clean messy code and push barricade outward.

---

### 1.6 Stronger Isolation Mechanisms

#### 1.6.1 Interpreters
- Execute untrusted code through a carefully written interpreter.
- Slow but safe.

#### 1.6.2 Virtual Machines and Containers
- Virtual machines emulate entire systems.
- Containers share host OS but isolate user space.
- Trade-off: Security vs. performance.

---

## 2. Python Programming Constructs

### 2.1 Functions and Lambdas
```python
f = lambda x, y: x + y + 1
g = f
```
- Functions are first-class callables.
- Can be assigned to other variables.

---

### 2.2 Python Classes and Inheritance

#### 2.2.1 Classes as Objects
- In Python, classes are regular objects.
- Can be dynamically created and assigned.
- Each class has a `__dict__` that stores its attributes.

#### 2.2.2 Inheritance Model
```python
class C(A, B):
    ...
```

- Multiple inheritance allowed.
- Python uses **depth-first left-to-right** search for method resolution, avoiding re-visits.
- Different from C++, JavaScript, etc.

---

### 2.3 Namespaces and Scoping
- Namespace: Collection mapping names to objects (essentially a `dict`).
- Each class, module, and function defines its own namespace.

---

## 3. Python Modules and Import System

### 3.1 Basic Module Mechanics

```python
# foo.py
a = 19
def f(x): return x + 1
class C: pass
```

```python
import foo
foo.a  # Access a
```

#### Import Behavior:
1. Creates a new namespace.
2. Executes source code within that namespace.
3. Binds module name (`foo`) in current namespace.

---

### 3.2 Conditional Imports and Namespace Collisions
```python
from foo import f   # Only imports 'f' from foo
from foo import *   # NOT recommended; imports all names
```
- Poor modularity due to possible collisions or overriding local names.
- Prefer explicit imports.

---

### 3.3 Special Variables
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    run_tests()
```

- `__name__` is `"__main__"` if the file is run as a script.
- Allows writing self-testing modules.

---

## 4. Python Package Structure

### 4.1 Hierarchical Organization
- Modules can be organized in a tree-like fashion.
- Each subdirectory must include an `__init__.py` file to be considered a package.

Directory example:
```
my_app/
├── __init__.py
├── utils/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── math_helpers.py
└── models/
    ├── __init__.py
    └── user.py
```

Import example:
```python
from my_app.utils import math_helpers
```

---

### 4.2 Relative Imports
```python
from ..utils import math_helpers
```
- Relative imports use `.` and `..` to navigate package hierarchy.

---

## 5. Package Installation and Distribution

### 5.1 Python Path
- `PYTHONPATH`: Environment variable listing directories to search for modules.
```bash
export PYTHONPATH=".:/usr/local/lib/python3.10/site-packages"
```

---

### 5.2 Pip – Python Package Manager
```bash
pip install numpy            # Install
pip uninstall numpy          # Uninstall
pip list                     # List installed packages
pip list --outdated          # List outdated packages
pip list --format=json       # Structured output
```

| Concern | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Dependencies | pip auto-installs dependencies |
| Compatibility | Must ensure packages work across environments |

---

### 5.3 Visualizing Package Ecosystem
- Python’s package ecosystem can be large and interdependent.
- Pip and packaging tools help manage versions and compatibility.

---

## 6. Evolving the Python Interpreter

### 6.1 Extending Python Beyond Libraries

- When libraries aren’t enough, modify the CPython interpreter.
- Submit Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs) to upstream Python.

Requirements:
- Provide working code (e.g., patches).
- Create a precise, implementation-independent specification.
- Ensure changes are backward compatible.

---

## 7. Moving Beyond Python – Building Binaries

### 7.1 Building Executables

Problem:
- Need to support C/C++/Rust etc., generating architecture-specific machine code.

Key complexities:
- Machine-specific code (e.g., x86-64 might differ slightly across machines).
- Tooling required differs vastly from interpreted languages.

---

### 7.2 Stakeholders in the Build Process

| Stakeholder | Role |
|------------|------|
| Developer | Writes source code |
| Builder | Compiles software |
| Distributor | Packages and ships executables |
| Installer | Installs binaries on target machines |

- These roles may involve automation (e.g., CI/CD pipelines).

---

### 7.3 Build Automation

Simple shell scripts for builds:
```bash
g++ -c foo.cc
gcc -c bar.c
g++ foo.o bar.o -o result
```

Limitations:
- Not platform-independent.
- Hard to handle incremental builds.
- Poor dependency tracking.
- Not scalable.

Better tools:
- Make, CMake, Bazel – covered in future lectures.

## Summary

This lecture examined a wide-ranging collection of advanced topics relevant to software development efficiency and robustness. It provided in-depth guidance on GDB-based low-level debugging, including stack analysis, conditional breakpoints, use of Python within GDB, and remote debugging practices. It then moved into higher-level development strategies involving code reliability and debugging alternatives such as assertions, exception handling, logging, checkpointing, and isolation techniques. A significant portion covered Python programming mechanics, detailing functional programming constructs, object-oriented features, class namespaces, and the Python module/package importing system. Finally, the discussion introduced modern build considerations, examining the practical issues developers face when automating builds for compiled language projects, and hinted at upcoming discussions on more complex build systems and tools.
