# HTML, the DOM, CSS, JavaScript, JSX, and Python Dictionaries

## 1. HTML: Structure and Design Principles

### 1.1 Origins and Goals
- HTML is based on SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language).
- SGML was designed with two key ideas:
  - **Portability** across different publishers.
  - **Separation** of content from form (presentation).
- HTML inherits the idea that:
  - **Content**: What the user wants to convey.
  - **Form**: How content is presented (appearance/style).
- HTML is declarative: it specifies desired output, not the steps required to achieve it.

### 1.2 Declarative vs. Imperative
- HTML is a declarative language: it describes what should appear on the screen (structure + content).
- JavaScript is imperative: describes how things should be done procedurally(logic + behavior).
- Original design philosophy:
  - Prefer HTML and CSS for content and styling.
  - Use JavaScript only when needed to control behavior.
- This philosophy wasn't always maintained in practice.


### 1.3 Goals in Designing HTML
- Support consistent rendering across different devices.
- Ensure that the same content can appear appropriately on laptops, phones, etc.
- Allow browsers the flexibility in rendering to improve usability and accessibility.

### 1.4 HTML Syntax and Elements

#### 1.4.1 HTML Elements
- An HTML element corresponds to a node in the document's tree structure (DOM).
- Basic syntax:
  ```html
  <tagname attribute="value">Content</tagname>
  ```
- The tree is kept in memory (DOM) by browsers and manipulated via JavaScript.

#### 1.4.2 Nesting and Valid Syntax
- Tags must be properly nested.
  - Invalid:
    ```html
    <a><b>…</a></b>
    ```
  - Valid:
    ```html
    <a><b>…</b></a>
    ```
- Mismatched or improperly nested tags typically render incorrectly, but browsers are forgiving.

#### 1.4.3 Optional and Void Tags
- Closing tags can sometimes be omitted if the structure is unambiguous.
- Void elements: represent standalone elements with no children.
  - Example:
    ```html
    <br>
    ```
  - Equivalent to:
    ```html
    <br></br>
    ```
    But HTML recommends using the shorter form.

### 1.5 Attributes
- Elements can have attributes: name-value pairs.
- Syntax:
  ```html
  <img src="image.jpg" width="500" height="300">
  ```
- The attribute name and value are strings and must be unique per element.
- Attributes must appear in the opening tag.

### 1.6 Types of Elements
| Element Type | Characteristics                          | Example Tags       |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| Normal       | Can contain mixed content and children    | `<p>`, `<div>`     |
| Raw Text     | Can only contain text (rare)              | Could be `<script>`|
| Void         | Cannot have any content or children       | `<br>`    |

### 1.7 DTD and HTML Versions
- Early HTML specified strict rules using DTD (Document Type Declaration).
- DTD specifies:
  - Which elements are allowed.
  - Their types (void, raw, normal).
  - Allowed attributes.
  - Valid nesting and element hierarchy.
- HTML 1–4 used this system.
- Issues:
  - Too rigid and slow to adapt to evolving browser innovation.
  - Standards couldn't keep pace with browser capabilities.

### 1.8 HTML5 and Living Standards
- HTML5 introduced in ~2008 with a "living standard" approach, abandoning rigid versioning.
- Living standard: constantly updated without version freezes.
- Specification now maintained online at w3.org.
- Practical and responsive to web development pace.
- Allows for more flexibility and quicker browser evolution.

### 1.9 Generous Syntax Parsing
- Browsers are forgiving: they parse incomplete or incorrect HTML to maximize content rendering.
- This ensures users see as much of the page as possible despite developer errors.
- Contrast to strict languages like C++ which halt on syntax errors.

## 2. XML vs HTML

### 2.1 XML Overview
- XML = Extensible Markup Language.
- Similar to HTML but stricter syntax.
  - Closing tags are mandatory.
- Domain-specific extensions.
- XML is declarative and used in data-exchange scenarios.
- XHTML is XML-based HTML.

### 2.2 XML Use Cases
- Used in government and enterprise applications for structured data.
- Useful when correctness and validation are important (e.g., social security data). Primarily used for Data transmission.

### 2.3 XML vs HTML Syntax
| Feature           | HTML                    | XML                       |
|------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| Closing Tags      | Often optional          | Required                  |
| Error Tolerance   | Very forgiving          | Strict                    |
| Usage             | Web pages (UI)          | Structured data, APIs     |

- XHTML is an XML variant used for well-formed HTML pages.
- Data governance is more reliable in XML (useful in critical fields).

## 3. DOM: Document Object Model

### 3.1 DOM Overview
- DOM: Tree of HTML content represented as objects.
- JavaScript accesses and manipulates this tree.
- Nodes correspond to elements, text, attributes, etc.

### 3.2 Key Properties
- Object-Oriented API to interact with the structure of a document.
- Represented in RAM by browsers.

### 3.3 Operations with DOM
- Navigation: locate elements (`getElementById`, etc.).
- Traversal: visit nodes to search or extract data.
- Modification: change structure, add or remove elements.

### 3.4 DOM APIs
- Provided by browsers.
- Language-agnostic (usable beyond JavaScript).
- JavaScript is the dominant language using DOM today.

---

## 4. CSS: Cascading Style Sheets
- Separates content (HTML) from presentation (style).
- Avoids embedding style details directly in HTML.

### 4.1 Problem with Early HTML Styling
- Direct styling embedded in content:
  ```html
  <i>italics</i> <b>bold</b>
  ```
- Mixed content and presentation, making adaptation difficult.

### 4.2 Modern Semantic Styling
- Use semantic tags:
  ```html
  <em>emphasis</em> <strong>strong emphasis</strong>
  ```
- Use CSS to define presentation.
- Advantages:
  - Makes pages accessible (e.g., screen readers for visually impaired).
  - Adapts better to various devices.

### 4.3 CSS Inheritance and Cascading
- Styles apply hierarchically.
- Child elements inherit parent's styles unless overridden.

### 4.4 Sources of Style

| Source     | Description                              |
|------------|------------------------------------------|
| Browser    | Default styles                          |
| User       | Custom overrides via browser settings   |
| Author     | Defined in the webpage/CSS files        |

### 4.5 Style Declaration
- Inline:
  ```html
  <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Styled Text</span>
  ```
- External:
  ```html
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
  ```

### 4.6 CSS Syntax Example
```html
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Sample Text</span>
```

```css
selector {
  property: value;
}
```

### 4.5 CSS Usage
- Designed for visual presentation (more design-focused).
- Collaboration between developers (logic) and designers (presentation).

## 5. JavaScript and JSX

### 5.1 JavaScript Basics
- Dynamic programming language embedded in HTML.
- More dynamic than Python (e.g., runtime decisions).
- Used for interactiveness and logic in webpages.

### 5.2 Embedding JavaScript in HTML
Two methods:

1. External File:

   ```html
   <script src="hello.js"></script>
   ```
   
2. Inline Code:

   ```html
   <script>
     // code here
   </script>
   ```

### 5.3 Reasons to Use External Scripts
- Pros:
  - Modularity and code reuse.
  - Easier updates.
  - Support for 3rd-party libraries (no copy-and-paste).
  - Better for copyright compliance.
- Cons:
  - One extra HTTP request
  - More complicated than inline scripts

---

## 6. JSX: JavaScript XML

### 6.1 What is JSX?
- A syntax extension to JavaScript used with React.
- Allows writing HTML-like code within JavaScript.
- Transpiled to standard JavaScript behind the scenes.

### 6.2 JSX Example
```jsx
const header = <h1 lang="en">CS35L Homework</h1>;
```

- JSX expressions can include variables:
  ```jsx
  const course = "CS35L";
  const header = <h1>{course} Homework</h1>;
  ```

### 6.4 JSX Rendering
```jsx
ReactDOM.render(header, document.getElementById("root"));
```
- Attaches the JSX-generated element to the DOM.

### 6.5 Nesting and Flexibility
- JSX supports deeply nested elements.
- JavaScript expressions can be embedded within curly braces.

## 7. Client-Server Data Transfer

### 7.1 JSON: JavaScript Object Notation
- Lightweight data-interchange format.
- Commonly used in web APIs and async data loading.
- Readable and writable directly in JavaScript.
- JSON is to JS as XML is to HTML

### JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
- Trees where labels apply to arcs (key-value pairs).
- Serialized JavaScript object representation.

Example:
```json
{
  "menu": {
    "id": "file",
    "value": "File",
    "popup": {
      "menuitem": [
        { "value": "New", "onclick": "CreateNewDoc()" },
        { "value": "Open", "onclick": "OpenDoc()" }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### 7.4 JSON vs XML Tree Representation

| Feature        | JSON                         | XML                              |
|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Label Position | On arcs (keys)               | On nodes (element names)          |
| Syntax         | Curly braces/arrays          | Tags with attributes              |
| Parsing        | Native in JavaScript         | Requires XML parser               |

### 7.5 Comparison to XML

| Feature           | JSON                        | XML                         |
|------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|
| Syntax Simplicity | Simpler                     | Verbose                     |
| Readability       | Easier horizontally         | Harder                      |
| Data Orientation  | Keys on arcs                | Tags on elements (nodes)     |
| Parsability       | Built into JavaScript       | Requires external library    |

| Format | Description                    | Example Usage                        |
|--------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| XML    | Verbose, hierarchical          | Government, legacy systems           |
| JSON   | Lightweight, JavaScript-native| Modern web applications              |

## 8. Browser Rendering Pipeline

### 8.1 Stages
1. Parse HTML → create DOM
2. Apply CSS → compute layout
3. Render → display pixels

### Optimization Strategies
- Lazy rendering: Start showing content before full parsing completion.
- Skip off-screen elements: Don’t render or execute their JS until visible.
- Parallel execution: JavaScript may run while parsing and rendering continues.
- Browsers render partially parsed HTML for responsiveness.

### 8.3 JavaScript and Rendering
- JavaScript execution may be delayed:
  - If DOM is not visible (e.g., below-the-fold elements).
  - If rendering is incomplete.
- JavaScript and rendering can interleave.
  - Can lead to race conditions if DOM is mutated before render.

| Issue                         | Explanation                             |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Self-modifying DOM            | JavaScript modifies the DOM during load |
| Deferred execution            | JS scripts for hidden elements may not run immediately|


### 8.4 Performance Tip
- Be careful where `<script>` tags are placed in HTML.
- Improper placement affects load speed and user experience.

### 8.5 Testing Concerns
- Fast local networks may hide timing issues.
- Must test on variable latency connections for robustness.

## 9. Python: Dictionaries and Data Types

### 9.1 Mapping Types – `dict` (Dictionaries)

- Stores key-value pairs.
- Keys must be hashable and immutable.
- Values can be of any type (mutable/immutable).

### 9.2 Syntax & Operations
```python
d = {"a": 1, "b": 2}
d["c"] = 3            # Add item
print(d["a"])         # Access value
del d["b"]            # Remove item
```

### 9.3 Core Dictionary Operations

| Method                   | Description                          |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `len(d)`                 | Number of key-value pairs             |
| `d.clear()`              | Remove all pairs                      |
| `d.copy()`               | Shallow copy of dictionary            |
| `d.items()`              | View object of (key, value) tuples    |
| `d.keys()`               | View object of keys                   |
| `d.values()`             | View object of values                 |

### 9.4 Views and Mutability

- `.items()`, `.keys()`, & `.values()` return view objects:
  - Dynamic: reflect changes in dictionary.
  - Not independently mutable.

### 9.6 Copying vs Assignment

#### Assignment:
```python
e = d  # e refers to the same dict as d
```

#### Copy:
```python
e = d.copy()  # new dict, shared keys/values
```

### 9.7 Shallow vs Deep Copy
- Shallow copy:
  - Dict is copied.
  - Mutable values (like lists) are shared.
  - `.copy()` is a shallow copy.
- Deep copy (via `copy.deepcopy()`):
  - Recursively copies everything, including values.
  
### 9.8 Dictionaries Are Ordered (Python 3.7+)
- Insertion order is preserved.
- Reassigning a key does not affect its position.
- Deleting and re-adding a key puts it at the end.

### 9.9 Iterating Over Dictionaries

#### Example:
```python
for key in d:
    print(key, d[key])
```

Or:
```python
for key, value in d.items():
    print(key, value)
```
