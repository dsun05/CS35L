# Debugging Without a Debugger and GDB Overview

## 1. Approaches to Debugging

### 1.1 Static Checking

- Static checking is done at compile-time.
- Tools such as `gcc` and `clang` can detect many problems before execution.
- Limitations:
  - Can't detect all bugs without running the program.
  - Based on theoretical limitations (e.g., the Halting Problem makes certain kinds of analysis undecidable).
  - Cannot detect bugs that only show up under specific runtime conditions.

### 1.2 Dynamic Checking

- Occurs during execution.
- Can catch bugs missed by static checking.
- Includes approaches like:
  - Manual checking via assertions.
  - Compiler/runtime features.
  - External tools.

#### 1.2.1 Manual Checks

- Add assertions to validate variable states at runtime.
- Example: Array bounds checking
  ```c
  if (!(0 <= i && i < n)) {
    error(); // Function declared as `[[noreturn]]` (does not return)
  }
  a[i];
  ```
- Example: Integer overflow (this won't catch overflow)
  ```c
  if (j * k > INT_MAX) {
    error();
  }
  ```
- Such checks are often verbose and error-prone.
- Correct method for overflow detection in newer standards:

  ```c
  #include <stdckdint.h>
  if (__builtin_mul_overflow(j, k, &i)) {
    error();
  }
  ```
  - In C: `__builtin_mul_overflow`
  - In C++26: Similar utilities

#### 1.2.2 GCC Sanitizer Flags

These are compiler flags that insert automatic runtime checks:

| Flag                    | Purpose                                               | Captures                       |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `-fsanitize=undefined`  | Catch undefined behavior (e.g., overflow)             | Integer overflow, divide by 0  |
| `-fsanitize=address`    | Catch memory/address issues                           | Buffer overflows, bad pointers |
| `-fsanitize=thread`     | Detect race conditions                                | Multi-thread concurrency bugs  |
| `-fsanitize=leak`       | Find memory leaks                                     | Leaked malloc() allocations    |

- Limitation: Some flags can't be used together (e.g., `undefined` vs `address`).
- Use based on most relevant category of bugs.

#### 1.2.3 Valgrind

- A tool for dynamic analysis.
- Works on compiled binaries — no need for recompilation with special flags.
- Detects:
  - Memory errors (accesses, leaks)
  - Some undefined behaviors
- Disadvantages:
  - Slower compared to sanitizer flags.
  - Works at binary level — lacks source code context.
  - May miss conceptual semantic errors.

##### Comparison Table

| Tool        | Source Required | Speed Impact   | Coverage               | Usability in Production |
|-------------|------------------|----------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| Sanitizers  | Yes (recompilation) | Moderate        | Targeted checks         | No                       |
| Valgrind    | No               | High           | Broader, but shallower | Yes                      |

#### 1.2.4 Compiler Flag: `-fwrapv`

- Forces signed integer overflow to wrap around (mod 2ⁿ).
- Helps code behave more predictably.
- Prevents certain optimizations (e.g., loop unrolling).
- Disabled by default for efficiency reasons.

##### Example: Loop Unrolling Optimization

Given:
```c
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
  f(i);
}
```

- If `n` is `INT_MAX`, `i++` might overflow.
- With `-fwrapv`, the compiler cannot assume overflow doesn’t happen, so it can't unroll the loop.

## 2. Portability Checking

- Portability = ensuring code runs on different platforms correctly.
- Examples:
  - Cross-browser JavaScript testing.
  - Cross-platform compilation (e.g., 32-bit vs 64-bit).
  - Combinations of OS/browser/plugins.

### 2.1 Practical Techniques

- Build and run on multiple environments.
- Use compiler flags like `-m32` to generate 32-bit binaries.

| Flag    | Purpose                             |
|---------|-------------------------------------|
| `-m32`  | Force 32-bit compilation on GCC     |
| default| Typically compiles to 64-bit binary  |

## 3. Test Cases

- Aimed **not** to prove that the code works, but to **find bugs**.
- Good testing mindset: “My test cases failed to find a bug — I failed.”

### 3.1 Test Infrastructure

- Automate test execution: shell scripts, `make check`, etc.
- Run tests in parallel with `make -j N`.
- Separate:
  - Quick/cheap tests: frequent execution
  - Heavy tests: nightly or weekly runs

#### 3.2 Useful Tools

- Scripts (`run_tests.sh`)
- Makefiles with targets like `check`
- GitHub Actions / CI Systems

### 3.3 Generating Test Cases

- Large Language Models (LLMs) can help generate test cases.
- Meta engineers report test case generation as an area where LLMs excel.
- Sweet spot: LLMs contribute 40–50% workload.

### 3.4 Complexity of Random Testing

- You can't mathematically **prove** randomness.
- You can test statistical properties:
  - Bit balance (equal 1s and 0s)
  - Lack of patterns
  - Distribution coverage

#### Example Anti-Test:
```c
// Bad random: Always returns a constant pattern
return UINT64_MAX / 3; // Alternating bits
```

- May pass naive tests but fail comprehensive statistical testing.

## 4. Defensive Programming Goals

- Prevent the bug beforehand.
- Minimize impact of bugs that *do* occur.
- Detect bugs early and reliably.

### 4.1 Techniques

- Static checking (compiler warnings)
- Dynamic checking (sanitizers, Valgrind)
- Test case design for failure
- Defensive coding (asserts, bounds checks)

## 5. Terminology

| Term     | Description                                         |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Error    | Developer’s mistake                                   |
| Fault    | Error reflected in the code                          |
| Failure  | Fault triggered during execution with bad symptoms  |

## 6. Debugging Best Practices

### 6.1 Effective Debugging Steps

1. **Reproduce/ Stabilize the failure**
   - Must be consistent and repeatable.
   - May require disabling features like ASLR.

2. **Locate the fault**
   - Use backwards reasoning.
   - Leverage debugger features to narrow down cause.

### 6.2 Anti-patterns

- Randomly modifying code lines hoping it works (futile).
- Avoid using GDB as a crutch; it's for reasoning — not fixing.

## 7. GDB: Debugger Basics

### 7.1 GDB’s Role

- GDB as a “Program Execution Explorer.”
- GDB operates by commanding the OS kernel to control/influence the debugged process.

### 7.2 Key GDB Commands

| Command     | Purpose                                    |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `run` / `r` | Start the program within GDB               |
| `quit` / `q`| Exit GDB                                   |
| `attach PID`| Attach to an already running process       |
| `detach`    | Detach from the debugged process           |

#### Setup Commands

| Command                         | Description                             |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `set cwd /path`                 | Set working directory for debugged proc |
| `set env VAR value`            | Set environment variable                |
| `set disable-randomization off`| Enable ASLR                              |

- ASLR: Address Space Layout Randomization
  - Helps prevent exploits
  - Hurts reproducibility for debugging
  - Usually **disabled** by default within GDB

### 7.3 Breakpoints

| Command     | Description                                      |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `break <loc>` / `b` | Set breakpoint at function or line        |
| `info break` / `ib` | List all breakpoints                      |
| `delete <num>` / `d`| Remove specified breakpoint               |

- Implementation: Replace instruction byte with a `trap` to pause execution.

### 7.4 Control Commands

| Command         | Action                                                      |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `continue` / `c` | Resume execution after break                                |
| `step` / `s`     | Step into the next line of source code (includes functions) |
| `next` / `n`     | Step over function calls                                    |
| `stepi`          | Step a single machine instruction                           |
| `finish`         | Run until current function returns                          |

### 7.5 Advanced Commands

| Command           | Purpose                                                                    |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `reverse-continue` / `rc` | Execute backwards to previous state (requires special setup)       |
| `watch <expr>`    | Set a watchpoint to break when expression value changes                    |
| `checkpoint` / `restart <n>` | Save and reload program state (coarse-grained reverse execution) |
| `print <expr>` / `p` | Evaluate and print a variable or expression                           |

### 7.6 Print Command Usage

- Example:
  ```gdb
  p a + b
  p my_struct.member
  p my_function()
  p exit(1)  // Dangerous: will cause program to terminate
  ```
- Can call custom functions in your code via `print`.

#### Calling Functions from GDB Caveats
- Temporarily hijacks execution.
- Can drastically modify state if misused.

## Summary

This lecture covered dynamic debugging techniques and deep strategies for finding and reasoning about bugs. It began by analyzing static vs dynamic checking, highlighted compiler options and tools like GCC Sanitizers and Valgrind, and delved into best practices for test case development. The lecture emphasized the limitations of test verification, especially for probabilistic behavior like random number generators. Terminology around errors, faults, and failures was clarified to promote precise debugging approaches. Finally, the lecture introduced GDB as a powerful but inefficient last-resort debugger and detailed its usage, including breakpoints, controlling program execution, reverse debugging, watchpoints, and introspection using print commands. The overarching theme emphasized preventing bugs proactively, detecting them robustly, and using debuggers like GDB as tools of last resort for precise reasoning.
