# 1. Overview of Low-Level Software Development

## 1.1 Context
- Focus on software written in C or C++, considered “low-level” compared to higher-level languages like Python or JavaScript.
- Programs need to be efficient and secure.
- While not diving into machine code, understanding low-level behavior is crucial.
- Tools for low-level development are more mature and powerful due to decades of evolution.

## 1.2 Attitude Toward Debugging
- Debuggers should be a last resort.
- Ideal approach involves avoiding debuggers through better tools and practices.
- Dependency on debuggers reflects failure in preventive design or tool usage.
- Alternative: Use **compiler features** for debugging.

# 2. Using Compilers for Debugging and Security

## 2.1 GCC and Clang
- **GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)** and **Clang** are the two most widely-used open-source compilers.
- Compatible in many respects, though options may differ.
  
## 2.2 Fortify Source

### Description
- Defined via: `-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2` (commonly recommended)
- Requires optimizations enabled (e.g., `-O2`).

### Purpose
- Replaces standard functions like `memcpy` with safer versions.
- Enhanced runtime checking.

### Example
```c
memcpy(destination, source, size);
```

- Compiler analyzes arrays, injects bounds information to prevent buffer overflows.
- Prevents overwriting critical internal data like return addresses.

### Limitations
- Not all calls to functions like `memcpy` can be analyzed.
- If compiler cannot determine object sizes, it defaults to the standard, unchecked version.
  
## 2.3 Stack Protection (`-fstack-protector`)

### Description
- Inserts a runtime check using a "canary" value before the function returns.

### Mechanism
- Canary is a random value inserted between local variables and the return address on the stack.
- Before return, the value is checked.
  - If modified → program crashes.

### Analogy
- Like a canary in a coal mine: detects danger early (e.g., buffer overflows).

### Conditions for Activation
- Only enabled for functions with local arrays of a certain size (commonly 8+ bytes).
- Can be disabled: `-fno-stack-protector`

### Limitations
- Not foolproof:
  - Return address may still be compromised if attacker guesses the canary.
- Fixed by making canary a random 64-bit value on each run.

## 2.4 Intel Control-Flow Enforcement Technology (CET)

### Usage
- Enabled with: `-fcf-protection`
- Hardware-enforced control flow integrity using **Shadow Stack**.

### Shadow Stack
| Normal Stack | Shadow Stack |
|--------------|---------------|
| Local vars   | Return address |
| Return addr  | Return address |

- Shadow stack is inaccessible to ordinary code.
- CALL pushes to both stacks; RET compares both.
- Mismatch → crash (traps into OS security checks).

### Benefits
- Prevents return address tampering.
- Hardware enforced = efficient, safe.

### Limitations
- Only available on new Intel/AMD CPUs.
- Not enabled by default in major distributions.

# 3. Improving Performance Using Compiler Features

## 3.1 Optimization Levels (`-O` flags)

| Flag   | Description                                 |
|--------|---------------------------------------------|
| -O0    | No optimization (default)                   |
| -O1    | Basic optimizations                         |
| -O2    | Moderate optimizations (safe & common)      |
| -O3    | Aggressive optimizations; may be buggy      |
| -Os    | Optimize for size instead of speed          |
| -Og    | Optimize for debugging (intended, rarely helpful in practice) |

### Caveats
- Higher levels (especially `-O3`, `-Ofast`) may introduce compiler bugs or make debugging harder.
- Optimizations may reorder instructions, contradicting step-through behavior in debuggers.

## 3.2 Build Scripts
- **Makefiles** or build systems control compilation, linking, and flag usage.
- Traditional C/C++ systems have mature build systems.

## 3.3 Use of `__builtin_unreachable()`

### Purpose
- Hint to compiler that a certain code path is unreachable.
- Enables aggressive optimization.

### Example
```c
if (a < 0) __builtin_unreachable();
x = a / 1024; // Compiler can optimize to x = a >> 10;
```

### Difference from `abort()`
- Does not generate crash-inducing code → better performance.
- Use `abort()` in debug mode, then switch to `__builtin_unreachable()` for release builds.

## 3.4 `__attribute__((cold))` / `__attribute__((hot))`

### Purpose
- Indicates functions that are rarely (`cold`) or frequently (`hot`) executed.
- Affects inlining and memory layout (cache optimizations).

### Example
```c
__attribute__((cold)) void error_log();
```

- Moves code to segment less likely to remain in instruction cache.

## 3.5 Profiling with `-fprofile-generate` and `-fprofile-use`

### Purpose
- Profile-Guided Optimization (PGO)
- Run instrumented binary to collect data → recompile using profiling info.

### Steps
1. Compile with `-fprofile-generate`
2. Run program (gathers profiling data)
3. Recompile with `-fprofile-use`

### Pros and Cons
- Can optimize based on real usage.
- Risk: test runs ≠ production behavior.

## 3.6 Link Time Optimization (`-flto`)

### Description
- Includes the source IR in object files.
- Allows full program optimization during link time.

### Advantages
- Enables inlining across modules.
- Produces smaller and faster code.

### Disadvantages
- Slow link times.
- Higher risk of compiler bugs.

# 4. Checking for Code Safety

## 4.1 Compile-Time Checking (Static)

### Examples

#### `static_assert`
```c
#include <assert.h>
static_assert(INT_MAX < UINT_MAX, "Int must be smaller than UInt");
```

### Compiler Warnings (using `-Wall` or `-W`)

| Flag             | Description                                      |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `-Wall`          | Enable commonly helpful warnings                 |
| `-Wparentheses`  | Warn about potentially confusing expressions     |
| `-Waddress`      | Warn about suspicious pointer comparisons        |
| `-Wstrict-aliasing` | Warn about type-punning across incompatible pointers |
| `-Wmaybe-uninitialized` | Warn if a variable might be used without initialization |
| `-Wtype-limits`  | Warn about comparisons that are always true/false due to unsigned types |

#### Example: Parentheses
```c
if (a + b << c)  // Ambiguous intent: parentheses may be needed
```

#### Example: Address Comparison
```c
char *p;
// ...
if (p == "abc") // Comparing pointer to string literal’s address
```

#### Example: Maybe Uninitialized
```c
int v;
if (n < 0) v = 3;
if (n < -10) return v; // Warning: v may be uninitialized
```

## 4.2 Use of `__attribute__`

### Function Attributes

| Attribute      | Description                                              |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `noreturn`     | Function does not return (e.g., `exit()`)               |
| `const` (a.k.a unsequenced) | No side-effects; return depends only on arguments |
| `pure` / `reproducible`    | No side-effects; may read global state       |
| `hot` / `cold` | Indicate call frequency for optimization                |

### Benefits
- Help compiler reorder safely
- Eliminate redundant calls
- Better code organization and performance.

## 4.3 Runtime Checking (Dynamic)

### Description
- Checking conditions dynamically as code runs.
- Can catch bugs not evident statically.

### Trade-offs
- Slows down execution.
- Detects bugs during tests but not all behaviors may be executed.

## 4.4 Safe Integer Arithmetic: `<stdckdint.h>`

### Example
```c
#include <stdckdint.h>

int r;
if (ckd_add(&r, a, b)) {
  // Overflow occurred
}
```

- `ckd_add`, `ckd_sub`, and similar functions return a boolean indicating overflow.
- Available as of C23.
- Safer and preferred for critical or security-sensitive systems.

# 5. Debugging Tools Summary

## Preferred Tools over Debuggers:
| Use Case           | Recommended Tool/Option                         |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Undefined Behavior | `-fsanitize`, `-Wall`, `static_assert`          |
| Stack Protection   | `-fstack-protector`, Shadow Stacks (CET)        |
| Buffer Overflow    | `_FORTIFY_SOURCE`, `-fsanitize=address`         |
| Performance        | `-O2`, `-O3`, PGO, `-flto`                       |
| Integer Overflow   | `<stdckdint.h>`                                 |
| Optimization hints | `__builtin_unreachable()`, `__attribute__((cold))` |

# 6. Summary

This lecture examined various strategies for improving performance, security, and correctness in low-level software development, particularly in languages like C and C++. Attendees were encouraged to move away from relying primarily on debuggers and instead leverage compiler features and options such as optimization levels, profiling, static and dynamic safety checks, safe arithmetic handling, and platform-specific features like Intel CET. The discussion covered tools such as GCC, Clang, and runtime libraries, while introducing modern standards like C23. Emphasis was placed on the importance of low-level awareness and compiler-aided development for writing reliable and efficient software.
