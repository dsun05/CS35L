## 1. Introduction to Scripting Languages

### 1.1 Key Distinctions

To fully understand scripting languages, one must consider three perspectives:

| Category     | Description                                               |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Syntax       | Refers to the structure or form of code (like semicolons, braces in C++). Considered solved and relatively easy. |
| Semantics    | Refers to the meaning or behavior of the program—what the code does. |
| Pragmatics   | Practical concerns of programming - efficiency, configuration, usability, security, and interoperability. Most emphasized in scripting. |

### 1.2 Scope and Focus

- Primary languages discussed:
  - Emacs Lisp
  - Python
- Focus is placed on pragmatics
- Comparisons made to Java, JavaScript, Shell scripting

## 2. Overview of Common Scripting Languages

### 2.1 Shell (SH)

- One of the earliest scripting languages (1970s).
- Used to configure and run programs.
- Still relevant today due to need for modular interaction with external programs.

#### Example
```sh
ls | grep "txt" | wc -l
```
- Applies functional principles using Unix pipes.

### 2.2 Emacs Lisp

- Not originally a scripting language, but adapted as one.
- Originated as a general purpose language designed to write AI programs in the 1960s.
- Used in Emacs as an "extension language".

#### Key Features:
- Self-modifying code and metaprogramming
- Integration deeply into the Emacs text editor
- Support for extensibility via primitives written for buffer, windows, interaction, etc.

### 2.3 Java

- Not a scripting language but contributed vital implementation ideas:
  - Bytecode abstraction
  - Interpreters and Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation
- Strong typing, performance-oriented, reliable

### 2.4 JavaScript

- Extension language for browsers
- Allows user-level customization in web environments
- Uses similar implementation techniques as Java (e.g., JIT, bytecode)

### 2.5 Python

- General-purpose scripting language
- Integration with AI and data science ecosystems
- Emphasizes code readability, quick prototyping, and integration of external modules
- Supports linking external libraries (often written in C/C++)

## 3. Characteristics of Scripting Languages

### 3.1 Ease of Use

- Designed to minimize the learning curve
- Example: Writing a simple Python program or launching a script in a shell requires no compiler knowledge

### 3.2 Reliability

| Language | Error Handling                    | Risk           |
|----------|-----------------------------------|----------------|
| C++      | May crash or corrupt memory       | High risk      |
| Python   | Throws exceptions, predictable    | Safer          |
| Emacs Lisp | Gives error messages, debuggable | Safer          |

- In C++, array out-of-bounds can trash memory.
- In scripting languages, bounds are checked and errors are caught.

### 3.3 Scalability

- Scripting languages are good for:
  - Small to medium programs
  - Glue code
  - Lightweight data transformation
- Problems occur with very large codebases due to:
  - Lack of strict typing
  - Fragmented tooling
- Python addresses this by integrating with C for computation-heavy tasks

### 3.4 Performance

- Scripting languages usually perform worse than compiled languages like C++ or Rust
- Tradeoff: slower performance for higher productivity
- Example: Python checks list bounds (safe but slow)

## 4. Concepts and Philosophical Differences

### 4.1 General vs. Extension Languages

| Language Type     | Example           | Description                                                                          |
|------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| General Purpose   | Python, Java      | Use it for almost anything                                                          |
| Extension         | JavaScript, ELisp | Embedded in host applications (e.g., browser, editor) to extend functionality       |

### 4.2 Traditional vs. Scripting

| Feature         | Scripting Languages           | Traditional Languages       |
|------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Performance      | Low                          | High                        |
| Flexibility      | High                         | Medium                      |
| Error Handling   | Graceful                     | Harsh (e.g. segfaults)      |
| Compilation      | Optional or runtime only     | Mandatory                   |

### 4.3 Functional Programming Aspects

- Pipeline constructs in shell resemble functional composition
- Emacs Lisp supports lambdas and high-order functions

#### Example
```elisp
(cons 3 (cons 4 nil)) ; Becomes (3 4)
```

### 4.4 Design Purpose of Languages

| Language        | Intended Use                                        |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| JavaScript      | Extending browser functionality                   |
| Shell           | Automated OS-level task and config scripts         |
| Emacs Lisp      | Extending the editor’s features                    |
| SQL             | Query and data specification                       |
| Rust            | High-performance and safe system programming       |

## 5. Emacs Lisp In-Depth

### 5.1 Emacs Structure and Interpretation

- EMACS is built on:
  - Low-Level C libraries
  - Lisp Interpreter written in C
- Code entered in Emacs is interpreted or compiled into bytecode

### 5.2 Expressions and Evaluation

- Lisp uses prefix notation:
  - Function comes first: (+ 34 27)
- `Control+J` in Emacs evaluates the last expression typed
- Apostrophe (') is used to treat code as data (quote)
  - `'(3 4)` returns a list, doesn’t evaluate

### 5.3 Debugging in Emacs

- Errors are caught in the debugger:
  - Example: typing `ABC` results in: “void variable” error
- Useful commands:
  - `C-]`: Exit debugger
  - `Control+H M`: Help on debugger mode

### 5.4 Data Types in Emacs Lisp

| Type        | Description                                                                             |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Number      | Integers (arbitrary precision), Floats (64-bit)                                         |
| String      | Double-quoted sequences of characters                                                   |
| Symbol      | Unique identifiers (e.g., abc)                                                          |
| Pair/Cons   | Basic list building unit (2 elements: car and cdr)                                      |
| List        | Linked list made up of cons cells                                                       |
| Vector      | Fixed-size sequence (like arrays)                                                       |
| Buffer      | Editable text region                                                                    |
| Marker      | Tracks cursor position within a buffer                                                  |
| Function    | Executable object, can be anonymous (lambda) or named                                   |
| Hashtable, Frame, Window, Process | Various infrastructure objects in Emacs                        |

#### Example of Quote vs Eval

```elisp
'(setf x 5)       ;; Returns list, doesn't evaluate
(eval '(setf x 5)) ;; Actually sets x to 5
```

### 5.5 List Processing

- Fundamental concept in Lisp: “List Processing”
- Built-in functions for lists:
  - `cons`: Construct a new pair
  - `car`: Return first element
  - `cdr`: Return rest of list

#### List Example

```elisp
(cons 'a (cons 'b nil)) ; => (a b)
```

#### Improper Lists

```elisp
(cons 'a 'b) ; => (a . b)
```

### 5.6 Special Forms and Lambdas

- Special Forms: Not ordinary functions, have custom evaluation rules
  - Examples: `quote`, `defun`, `let`, `lambda`, `if`

#### Lambda Example

```elisp
((lambda (x y) (+ x y)) 3 4) ; => 7
```

- Used to define anonymous functions on-the-fly

### 5.7 Defining and Calling Functions

- Using `defun`:
```elisp
(defun add-three (x) (+ x 3))
```

- Interactive Commands:
  - Use `interactive` keyword
```elisp
(defun greet-user ()
  (interactive)
  (message "Hello!"))
```

- Example:
```elisp
(defun show-buffer-name ()
  (interactive)
  (message (buffer-name)))
```

- `let`: Defines local variables
```elisp
(let ((x 3) (y 4)) (+ x y)) ; => 7
```
