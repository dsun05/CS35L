## 1. Introduction

This lecture covers the foundations of Internet technology, key concepts around protocol layers, and how these technologies underpin the development of the World Wide Web. Topics include the problems related to packet-switched networking, layered protocols, TCP/IP stack, and core web services such as HTTP, HTTPS, and HTML.

## 2. Networking Foundations

### Packet Switching vs. Circuit Switching

- **Circuit Switching**: A dedicated communication path is established (e.g., traditional telephone).
- **Packet Switching**: Data is sent in small units (packets) that may take different paths to the destination (used in the Internet).

### What is a Packet?

- A small unit of data (typically ~1 KiB).
- Two components:
  - **Header**: Contains metadata the network needs (e.g., destination, protocol type).
  - **Payload**: Actual user data, intended for the application.

### Network Protocols

- Agreements or rules for communication between networked systems.
- Analogous to diplomatic protocols: improper format results in ignored packets.
- Each protocol layer defines what the structure and behavior of data exchanges look like.

---

## 3. Problems with Packet-Switched Networks

Because packets travel independently, several challenges arise:

### 1. Packet Loss

- Common causes: router overload (buffer overflow), network congestion.
- Packets can be silently dropped.
- Loss rate varies: 1% to over 50% under high load.

### 2. Packets Received Out of Order

- Common due to multiple network paths.
- Can confuse applications requiring strict order (e.g., file uploads).

### 3. Packet Duplication

- Unusual, but possible with network misconfigurations (e.g., routers misconfigured as bridges).

### 4. Packet Corruption (implied under checksum discussion)

- Bit errors due to unreliable hardware, faulty links.
- Need checksum/error-detection mechanisms.

---

## 4. Layered Network Protocol Architecture

To handle network complexity and address challenges modularly, protocols are structured into layers.

| Layer             | Functionality                                               |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Application       | High-level data exchange (e.g., HTTP, HTML)                 |
| Transport         | Reliable or fast delivery (e.g., TCP, UDP)                  |
| Internet          | Routing across the network (e.g., IP)                       |
| Link              | Data link between adjacent network nodes                    |

### Notes:

- Layers act as abstractions over lower ones.
- Data encapsulation uses headers at each layer.

## 5. The Internet Layer

### IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4)

- Introduced in 1983 (John Postel, UCLA alum).
- Connectionless — just delivers packets.
- Contains critical header fields:

| Field             | Purpose                                                                            |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Length            | Total size (bytes) of packet                                                       |
| Protocol number   | Allows demux to the correct higher-level protocol (e.g., TCP, UDP)                 |
| Source IP         | 32-bit address of sender                                                           |
| Destination IP    | 32-bit address of recipient                                                        |
| Time To Live (TTL)| Prevents infinite loops by discarding packets after a set number of hops           |
| Checksum          | Detects accidental data corruption                                                 |

#### Notation Example for IP Address:

- Binary: 11000000.10101000.00000000.00000001
- Decimal: 192.168.0.1

### Limitations of IPv4

- 32-bit address space (~4.3 billion addresses) proved insufficient.
- Large headers and lack of certain metadata features.

### IPv6

- Introduced in 1998, addresses shortage issues.
- Features:
  - 128-bit addresses
  - More header fields
  - Additional features (not covered in detail)
- 40% adoption (still increasing)
- Efficiency trade-offs due to extra header size

---

## 6. Transport Layer Protocols

The transport layer handles reliable delivery and communication sessions.

### UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

- Designed by David Reed (MIT)
- Minimal wrapper over IP
- Features:
  - Unreliable and unordered delivery
  - Low overhead, suitable for:
    - Streaming sensors (e.g., temperature updates)
    - Real-time applications (willing to tolerate some loss)
- Does not resolve packet issues like loss or order

### TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

- Designed by Vint Cerf (UCLA alum) and Bob Kahn
- Adds:
  - **Reliability**: Retransmission of lost packets
  - **Ordered data**: Reassembly of out-of-order packets
  - **Error checking**: End-to-end validation
- Built-in mechanisms:

| Mechanism         | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Flow Control      | Avoid flooding networks. Sender adjusts speed based on network conditions. |
| Retransmission    | Re-sends lost data                                                         |
| Reassembly        | Orders packets before delivering to application                            |

## 7. The Web

Invented by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN with two main components:

1. **HTTP** (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
2. **HTML** (Hypertext Markup Language)

### Original Goals:

- Create a simple way to share and navigate research papers.
- Relied on:
  - Simple document formatting (HTML)
  - Simple app-layer protocol (HTTP over TCP)

### First Web Server:

- Hosted on Berners-Lee’s NeXT workstation
- Sign: “Do not power off” — critical to early web functionality

---

## 8. HTTP Protocol Overview

### HTTP/1.0

- Based on a **request-response** model.
- Cannot multiplex; single request per TCP connection.

#### Example Request:

```http
GET / HTTP/1.0
<empty line>
```

#### Example Response Header:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Tue, 01 Jan 2020 00:00:00 GMT
Server: Apache
Content-Length: 12345
Content-Type: text/html
Connection: close
```

### HTTP/1.1

- Adds:
  - Persistent connections
  - Host header support (supports multiple domains per server)
  - Slightly better efficiency than HTTP/1.0

## 9. HTTP Protocol Evolution

| Version  | Year | Key Features                                                                      | Approx Usage            |
|----------|------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| HTTP/1.0 | 1990s| One request per connection                                                          | Legacy usage             |
| HTTP/1.1 | 1999 | Persistent connections, Host headers                                                | ~10%                     |
| HTTP/2   | 2015 | Based on TCP; improves performance                                                  | ~59%                     |
| HTTP/3   | 2022 | Based on UDP via QUIC; optimized for real-time media                               | ~32%                     |

### HTTP/2 Enhancements

- Built on TCP
- Improves transport bottlenecks with:

| Feature         | Purpose                                                                   |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Header Compression | Reduces size of repetitive headers                                     |
| Server Push     | Server sends multiple resources as a response                             |
| Pipelining      | Multiple requests dispatched without waiting for responses sequentially   |
| Multiplexing    | Allows interleaved transmission of multiple streams (faster responses)    |

### HTTP/3 and QUIC

- Built atop **QUIC**, which uses **UDP**
- Motivation: avoid TCP’s “head-of-line blocking”
- Enables:
  - Partial loss tolerance (key for streaming apps like Zoom)
  - Encryption by default (TLS is integral)
  - Better performance over unreliable networks

### QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections)

- Built by Google (Jim Roskind)
- Supports:
  - Streams with tolerable loss
  - Multiple streams between two endpoints
  - Improved performance compared to TCP

## 10. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)

### Origins

- Based on **SGML** (Standard Generalized Markup Language) used in publishing
- HTML = SGML + Hypertext/Interactive capabilities
- Berners-Lee simplified SGML:
  - Allowed lowercase tags
  - Introduced links and interactive elements for web navigation

### HTML Syntax Example

```html
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<a href="http://example.com">Click here</a>
```

| Tag           | Meaning                             |
|---------------|--------------------------------------|
| `<p>`         | Paragraph                            |
| `<a>`         | Hyperlink (anchor)                   |

## Summary

This lecture introduced foundational concepts of Internet technology and packet-switched networking, with a focus on the importance of protocol layers in handling reliability, order, and communication abstraction. It covered key network layers (link, internet, transport, application) and exemplified how the issues of packet loss, duplication, and disorder are abstracted away primarily in the transport layer via protocols like TCP. The lecture also analyzed the evolution of the web, beginning with the HTTP and HTML protocols invented by Tim Berners-Lee, illustrating how higher-layer web services rely on and build upon the lower networking layers. Finally, it delved into modern advancements such as HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 and their performance optimizations and trade-offs.
