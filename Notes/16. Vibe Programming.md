# Detailed Notes on Vibe Programming and AI-Driven Software Development

---

## 1. Introduction: Vibe Programming Overview

### 1.1 Guest Lecture by Prof. Kerry Nachenberg
- Demonstration-centered lecture with live coding.
- Topic: Vibe Programming—AI-assisted software development.
- Goal: Understand the current capabilities and workflows of AI agents in software construction.

## 2. What is Vibe Programming?

### 2.1 Definition
- Coined by Andrej Karpathy (AI expert).
- Karpathy's description:
  > “Fully give into the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists.”
- Formalized definition from ChatGPT-3:
  - "An informal AI-assisted approach where you prototype by chatting with a model, iterating code, tweaking prompts, and following intuition instead of detailed upfront specs."

### 2.2 Interpretation of “Embrace Exponentials”
- AI capabilities are increasing at an exponential pace.
- Research shows LLMs (Large Language Models) can now complete hour-long human tasks with much greater success than before.
- Progress occurs in roughly 7-month doubling intervals.

## 3. The Spectrum of Vibe Programming

| Phase               | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| LLM Assistance      | Use AI for small tasks (e.g., generating functions or boilerplate code).   |
| Collaboration       | Human and AI co-develop; AI handles sections, humans debug and integrate.  |
| Full AI Generation | AI builds complete applications without human-written code (Pac-Man example).|

### 3.1 Real-World Adoption
- Y Combinator: 20% of teams use AI to build the majority of their products.
- 95% of code written by AI in some startups.

---

## 4. Tools of Vibe Programming

### 4.1 Cursor (Modified VS Code)
- IDE based on VS Code optimized for AI-assistance.
- Allows multi-file projects, shell access, testing integration.
- Eliminates need for manual file management (copy-pasting from ChatGPT, etc.)

### 4.2 Other Tools
- Claude Code
- Codex (OpenAI)
- Google’s Gemini

### Recommendation
- Use ChatGPT for one-off scripts or simple files.
- Use Cursor or similar AI IDEs for even moderately complex projects.

## 5. Understanding Agentic AI

### 5.1 What is an Agent?
- A software system that couples:
  - An LLM (e.g., GPT-4, Claude)
  - A Tool/API Layer (e.g., filesystem, shell)

### 5.2 Components in Agentic Framework
1. **Client (IDE):** Cursor (VS Code fork); interfaces with local files/shell.
2. **Backend Server:** Hosted by Cursor to enrich/route prompts.
3. **LLM:** External model used to generate commands and logic.

### 5.3 Agent Commands (Examples)

| Action                | Command Format (JSON-like)                                                      |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Google Search         | { "command": "search", "query": "what is pathfinding?" }                      |
| Read From File        | { "command": "read_file", "path": "src/main.ts" }                             |
| Write File            | { "command": "write_file", "path": "game.ts", "data": "..."}                 |
| Execute Shell Command | { "command": "shell", "cmd": "npm start"}                                     |
| Display Message       | { "command": "message", "text": "Task completed successfully!"}               |

## 6. Agentic Workflow Architecture

### 6.1 Flow of Execution
1. User command (e.g., "Fix bug in foo").
2. Sent to backend server.
3. Server affixes command schema (available commands).
4. Prompt sent to LLM.
5. LLM returns a command (e.g., read a file).
6. Backend interprets and executes the command via client.
7. Feedback (e.g., file contents) appended to prompt.
8. Repeat until desired output is attained.

### 6.2 Prompt Management
- Every interaction (question/response) builds on prior ones.
- Context accumulation can cause confusion:
  - Known issue: Older instructions clutter context.
  - Solution: Re-initialize sessions regularly.

## 7. Key Concepts Before Starting Vibe Programming

### 7.1 Coding Rules Configuration
- Specify constraints and style guidelines.
  
Examples:
```text
- When possible, reuse or refactor existing code.
- Don't introduce new frameworks without confirmation.
- Make minimal required changes.
```

### 7.2 Requirements Gathering

| Component           | Description                                                                             |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Functional Req.     | What the software must do. UI behavior, game physics, etc.                             |
| User Stories        | Describe how users interact.                                                           |
| Framework/API Info  | Specify preferred tech stack.                                                          |
| UI Mockups          | Visual layouts, wireframes, integration with tools like Figma.                         |
| Business Rules      | Define backend logic and constraints.                                                  |
| Testing Req.        | Define how the code is tested, e.g., unit tests.                                       |
| Performance/Security| Specify expectations for runtime or safety.                                            |
| Acceptance Criteria | Define success conditions for tasks and project.                                       |

## 8. Demonstration Project: 3-Player Pong Game in TypeScript

### Process
1. **PRD Generation** (Product Requirements Document)
   - Formal structure: purpose, features, scope, stretch goals.
   - Generated by GPT using task description.

   - Example Attributes:
     - TypeScript, Canvas API use.
     - 3 paddles: left, right, bottom.
     - Ball gameplay logic, UI screen flow.

2. **Dependency-Aware Task List**
   - Created from PRD.
   - Includes ordered and split sub-tasks.

   Example (simplified):
   - T1: Setup project
   - T2: Create main loop
   - T3: Create Paddle class
   - T4: Create Ball class
   - T5: Implement input handling
   - T6: Implement collision detection

3. **Implementation using Cursor**
   - Tasks executed in order via automated prompting.
   - Human triggers one task at a time.
   - Cursor performs:
     - File creation
     - Code generation
     - Package installation
     - Updates UI and gameplay

## 9. Debugging with Vibe Programming

### 9.1 Bugs and Failures
Types:
- Off-rails: Non-functional or highly illogical generations.
- Partial bugs: Small issues amidst working components.

### 9.2 Procedure for Debugging
1. Start Clean Chat.
2. Clearly Describe Issue.
3. Ask for Root Cause Suggestions.
4. Add Diagnostics (e.g., logging).
5. Run Program and Gather Output.
6. Ask for Fix.
7. If Fix Fails → Revert and try different model.

### 9.3 Debugging Strategies
- Retry with Different LLM Model (e.g., Claude, Gemini).
- Avoid "fix on top of fix."
- Use diagnostics to iteratively narrow issue.
- Use revert/restore for checkpointing.

## Summary

This lecture explored the evolving paradigm of Vibe Programming—a method of AI-assisted software development that leverages large language models and integrated agentic systems to generate and manage code. The concept, introduced by Andrej Karpathy, is built on a spectrum from simple LLM assistance to full AI-driven codebases. The lecture emphasized the importance of clear requirements, tooling like Cursor for agentic workflows, and formalized processes such as PRD and dependency-aware task lists.

It provided a deep dive into the architecture of agentic AI, demonstrating how JSON-based command exchanges between user, server, and model guide automated code generation and problem-solving within development environments. Debugging strategies, coding rules, and requirement gathering were also covered, showing how developers can maximize AI's utility while avoiding pitfalls like hallucinations, model confusion, and inappropriate code rewrites.

The session concluded with insights into the current and future job market implications, security risks, and empirical observations on AI effectiveness, suggesting that while AI tools are improving developer productivity, human oversight and understanding remain indispensable for building robust and secure systems.
