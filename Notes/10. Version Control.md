# 1. Introduction to Version Control and Backups

## 1.1 Overview
- Version control manages software project history and helps maintain:
  - Backups of source code across different points in time (daily, weekly, yearly).
  - Ability to restore earlier versions of files and recover from failure.

- Backup and version control are related, yet distinct:
  - **Backups**: General concept applicable to many contexts, not limited to source code.
  - **Version Control**: Specialized backups tailored for software development.

## 1.2 Importance of Backups
- Ensures recovery from unexpected failures such as:
  - Deleted or overwritten files.
  - Hardware failure (e.g., flash drive failure).
  - Malicious attacks (insider or hacker-initiated).
  - Software bugs causing data loss.

- Real-life example:
  - Student inability to provide project files for credit transfer due to deleted data.

# 2. Roles in Backup Strategies

## 2.1 Traditional Division of Labor
| Role         | Description                                       |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Developers   | Innovate and create new functionality             |
| Operations   | Ensure system stability and maintain backups      |

## 2.2 DevOps Approach
- Merge development and operations responsibilities.
- All personnel handle both maintenance and innovation.
- Advantage: streamlines deployments, backup management, and failure recovery.

# 3. Understanding Failures

## 3.1 Failure Modeling
- Essential to design effective backup strategies.
- Know which specific failure types you want to protect against.

## 3.2 Types of Failures
| Type                   | Description                                               |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Hardware               | Flash/disk drive fails (e.g., 1–2% AFR for flash drives)   |
| User Error             | Accidental deletions or file overwrites                   |
| Attacker Action        | External or internal attacks leading to deletion/modifying of data |
| Software Bug           | Bug in application corrupting or deleting data            |
| Insider Threats        | Internal accounts tampering with data                     |

## 3.3 Annualized Failure Rate (AFR)
- Metric indicating expected percentage of device failures annually.
- Flash drives: 1–2% AFR.
- Hard disks: ~2–4% AFR.

# 4. Simple Backup Models

## 4.1 Mirroring
- Maintain two identical copies of all data.
- Provides fault tolerance for single drive failure.

### Pros:
- Simple and effective against single point of failure.

### Cons:
- Doubles storage cost.
- Assumes failure independence, which may not be valid:
  - Drives might come from the same faulty batch.
  - Shared environment increases correlated failures.

## 4.2 Revised AFR Calculation (Considering Recovery Time)
- Assume:
  - Drive replacement/copy takes time (e.g., 10 hours).
  - Good maintenance (ping notification, prompt replacement).
- Revise original pessimistic estimate:
  - Not just combining drive probabilities; must factor in recovery duration.
  - Resulting AFR is significantly lower when replacement time is considered.
- Formula:
  - 0.01 * (0.01 * (drive replacement time/1 year))

# 5. Failure and Recovery Models

## 5.1 Recovery Models Are Essential
- Common pitfall: engineers model failure but not recovery.
- Example:
  - Force-testing recovery by unplugging devices to simulate drive failures.

## 5.2 Advice for Practitioners
- Test backup strategies in real scenarios.
- E.g., simulate laptop loss over a weekend—can you still complete your work?

# 6. What to Back Up

## 6.1 Basic Data Components
| Category           | Description                            |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------|
| File contents      | Main data content                      |
| File names         | Essential for reference and recovery    |
| Directory structure| Organizational hierarchy               |

## 6.2 Additional Metadata
- Permissions, ownership, access rights (LS -l info)
- Timestamps (modification time)
- Inode/link count (preserving hard links)
- Symbolic link contents and types
- Backup meta information:
  - Version number, backup timestamp, creator

## 6.3 Delicate Files to Handle
- Passwords, encryption keys
  - Avoid storing in backup (or secure separately)
  - Industry incidents caused by mismanagement of sensitive files.

# 7. Backup Strategies

## 7.1 Periodic Backups and Incrementals
- Full backup: capture entire system at a moment in time.
- Incremental backup: capture only changed files since last snapshot.

### Pros:
- Saves space and time.
- Efficient for systems with infrequent changes.

### Cons:
- Restoring from multiple incrementals requires reliability of all intermediaries.

## 7.2 Incremental/Rotational Backups
- Manage storage growth by consolidating or deleting old backups.
- Examples:
  - Keep hourly backups for recent days.
  - Retain only weekly/daily backups for older data.
- Combine adjacent incrementals into one.

# 8. Efficient Backup Techniques

## 8.1 Incremental with Diffs
- Use `diff` to compute file differences.
- Only store changes (patches) rather than full file content.
- Use `patch` to restore original.

### Example:
```bash
diff -u old_file new_file > changes.diff
patch old_file < changes.diff
```

## 8.2 Cost-Effective Strategies
| Strategy                 | Benefit                                                            |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Run backups less frequently | Reduces system load and space utilization                     |
| Use cheaper backup devices | Hard drives, tapes instead of SSD for cost savings             |
| Remote backups (Cloud)   | Offload storage, better for small orgs with no infrastructure     |
| Use patches/diffs        | Store changes only, not entire files                              |

## 8.3 Data Grooming
- Avoid backing up redundant or recreatable files (e.g., `.o` files).
- Customize grooming scripts as part of pre-backup routines.

# 9. More Optimization Techniques

## 9.1 Deduplication
- Avoid storing identical content multiple times.
- Block-level deduplication — shared blocks between files.
- Uses Copy-On-Write (COW):
  - Create new block only when actual edit occurs.

### Caveats:
- Loss of any shared block may affect multiple files.
- Not a replacement for redundant physical copies.

## 9.2 Compression and Encryption
| Technique    | Advantage                                |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Compression  | Reduces backup size (e.g., gzip)          |
| Encryption   | Secures data against unauthorized access  |

## 9.3 Multi-Tier (Staged) Backups
- Tiered system: Flash → Disk → Tape.
- Keep tape for seldom accessed long-term data.
- Disk for mid-frequency access.

## 9.4 Multiplexing
- Single backup target for multiple data sources.
- Saves cost on dedicated backup hardware.

## 9.5 Checksum Verification
- Validate backup integrity using checksums (e.g., SHA256).
- Store checksums with backups.
- Cheap way to verify that backups are still correct.

# 10. From Backups to Version Control

## 10.1 Additional Requirements
- Backups are not enough.
  - Software developers require additional functionality for efficiency.

## 10.2 Developer-Oriented Needs
| Feature                        | Description                                                     |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Efficient lookups              | Quick access to older source versions                           |
| File rename tracking           | Recognize file renames to preserve history                      |
| Metadata for releases/tags     | Track different software versions (e.g., `v3.5`)                |
| Atomic commits                 | Bundle together logically consistent changes                    |
| Integration with workflows     | Hooks (pre/post commit) for enforcing policy                    |
| Format conversion              | Normalize line endings (CRLF vs LF) based on platform           |
| Signed commits                 | Verify authenticity of contributor                              |

# 11. Git: A Modern Version Control System

## 11.1 Git Core Concepts

### 11.1.1 Git is an Object Database
- Tracks project history as a set of objects stored persistently.
- Objects include:
  - Files (blobs)
  - Directory trees
  - Commits
  - Tags

### 11.1.2 Git has an Index (Staging Area)
- Working buffer for planned changes.
- Allows for selective commits and fine control.
- Private and local (not shared with other users).

| Component     | Purpose                            |
|---------------|-------------------------------------|
| Object DB     | Stores complete shared history      |
| Index (Cache) | Contains personal future intentions |

## 11.2 Best Practices
- Use the staging area (index) to build clean commits.
- Avoid committing broken or experimental code.
- Let the index act as a sandbox before finalizing history.

# 12. Git Operations Demonstrated

## 12.1 `git clone`
- Copies:
  1. Complete project history (object database)
  2. Index and working files
- Can be local or over network

## 12.2 Local Clone Optimization
- Faster because:
  - Uses hardlinks instead of copies
  - Avoids network
  - Utilizes deduplication strategies

## 12.3 Working Files
- Normal source code files on disk.
- Developers interact with these using standard tools (e.g., build/scripts).

# 13. Version Control Advanced Features

## 13.1 Git Hooks
| Hook Type      | Trigger Point         | Use Case                                                |
|----------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Pre-commit     | Before commit is finalized | Linting, tab checker, regression tests                |
| Post-commit    | After commit succeeds  | Notifications, metrics collection                        |

## 13.2 Signed Commits
- Protect against impersonation or malicious contributions.
- Use cryptographic key (GPG) to sign.

## 13.3 Format Conversion
- Git manages line-ending conversions:
  - Ensures Windows and Unix style line endings are used appropriately.

# Summary

This lecture provided an in-depth exploration of backup strategies and how they integrate with version control systems, particularly Git. It began with the fundamental purposes of backups—primarily to recover from hardware failure, user errors, and malicious attacks—and outlined the necessity of thorough failure and recovery models. The lecture covered several efficient backup techniques including mirroring, rotation, incremental backups with diff algorithms, deduplication, and multipurpose strategies like compression and staging.

The lecture then transitioned into the unique needs of software developers managing versioned history of codebases. It discussed features critical for version control, such as atomic commits, metadata (tags), rename tracking, and integration through Git hooks. It introduced Git as both an object database for shared history and a local index for staging planned changes. The session concluded with hands-on Git operations like `git clone`, local duplications via hard links, and working file management, emphasizing efficient practices and the importance of using the index constructively.
