# Lecture 15: Debugging Without a Debugger & GDB Deep Dive

## 1. Debugging Without a Debugger

### 1.1 Static Checking
- **Static checking** is performed at compile-time using tools like `gcc` and `clang`.
- **Other static tools:**
  - **Linters:** e.g., `cpplint`, `clang-tidy` for style and bug patterns.
  - **Static analyzers:** e.g., Coverity, Clang Static Analyzer, Infer (Facebook), which can find deep bugs across function boundaries.
  - **Formal verification:** Mathematical proofs of correctness (rare in practice, used in safety-critical systems).
- **Limitations:**
  - Cannot catch all bugs (e.g., runtime-specific issues).
  - Theoretical limits (e.g., Halting Problem) prevent perfect static analysis.
  - May produce false positives/negatives.

| Tool/Method         | What It Checks                | Example Tool         |
|--------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------|
| Compiler Warnings  | Syntax, types, some logic     | `-Wall`, `-Wextra`  |
| Linter             | Style, simple bug patterns    | `cpplint`, `pylint` |
| Static Analyzer    | Deep logic, interprocedural   | Clang Static Analyzer, Coverity |
| Formal Verification| Mathematical correctness      | Frama-C, SPARK      |

### 1.2 Dynamic Checking
- **Dynamic checking** occurs during program execution.
- Catches bugs missed by static checking, but only for the specific run/test case.
- **Manual dynamic checks:**
  - Add assertions to validate state at runtime.
  - Example: Array bounds checking
    ```c
    if (!(0 <= i && i < n)) error();
    a[i];
    ```
  - Example: Integer overflow (incorrect check)
    ```c
    if (j * k > INT_MAX) error(); // This does NOT work in C/C++
    ```
    - In C/C++, signed integer overflow is undefined behavior. The implementation can do anything, so the check above is unreliable.
  - **Correct overflow check (C23/C++26):**
    ```c
    #include <stdckdint.h>
    if (__builtin_mul_overflow(j, k, &i)) error();
    ```
    - `__builtin_mul_overflow` returns true if overflow occurred.
    - C++26 will have similar utilities.
  - **Downsides:**
    - Tedious and error-prone to add checks everywhere.
    - Easy to make mistakes in the checks themselves.

#### 1.2.1 GCC Sanitizer Flags
- Compiler flags that insert runtime checks for various classes of bugs:

| Flag                    | Purpose                                               | Captures                       |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `-fsanitize=undefined`  | Catch undefined behavior (e.g., overflow)             | Integer overflow, divide by 0  |
| `-fsanitize=address`    | Catch memory/address issues                           | Buffer overflows, bad pointers |
| `-fsanitize=thread`     | Detect race conditions                                | Multi-thread concurrency bugs  |
| `-fsanitize=leak`       | Find memory leaks                                     | Leaked malloc() allocations    |

- **Limitations:**
  - Some flags cannot be used together (e.g., `undefined` vs `address`).
  - Not all undefined behaviors are caught (e.g., some pointer aliasing bugs).
  - These flags slow down execution.
  - Only effective if the code path is executed during testing.

#### 1.2.2 Valgrind
- Tool for dynamic analysis at the binary level (no recompilation needed).
- Detects memory errors, leaks, and some undefined behaviors.
- **Advantages:**
  - Can be used on production binaries.
  - No need for special compilation flags.
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Much slower than sanitizer flags (interprets each instruction).
  - Lacks source code context, so may miss semantic errors.
  - Cannot catch all concurrency bugs or logic errors.

| Tool        | Source Required | Speed Impact   | Coverage               | Usability in Production |
|-------------|----------------|---------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Sanitizers  | Yes            | Moderate      | Targeted checks        | No                     |
| Valgrind    | No             | High          | Broader, shallower     | Yes                    |
| Fuzzers     | Yes            | High          | Randomized input paths | No                     |

#### 1.2.3 Compiler Flag: `-fwrapv`
- Forces signed integer overflow to wrap around (modulo 2ⁿ).
- Makes code more predictable, but disables some optimizations (e.g., loop unrolling).
- **Not the default** because it can slow down code and prevent optimizations.

##### Example: Loop Unrolling
```c
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
  f(i);
}
```
- If `n` is `INT_MAX`, `i++` might overflow.
- With `-fwrapv`, the compiler cannot assume overflow doesn't happen, so it can't unroll the loop.

### Table: Static vs. Dynamic Checking
| Aspect           | Static Checking                | Dynamic Checking                |
|------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| When Performed   | Compile-time                  | Run-time                        |
| Tools            | Compiler, linters, analyzers  | Assertions, sanitizers, Valgrind|
| Bugs Detected    | Syntax, type, some logic      | Memory, concurrency, runtime    |
| Overhead         | None at runtime               | Slows down execution            |
| Limitations      | Can't catch runtime-specific  | Only checks tested code paths   |

#### More Dynamic Tools
- **Fuzzers:** e.g., AFL, libFuzzer. Generate random/semi-random inputs to find crashes and bugs.
- **Dynamic analyzers:** e.g., Dr. Memory, ThreadSanitizer (for race conditions).

### Assertions: Static vs. Runtime
- **Runtime assertions:** Checked during execution. Can be compiled out with `-DNDEBUG`.
- **Static assertions:** Checked at compile time (e.g., `static_assert` in C11/C++11).
- **Pitfall:** Assertions with side effects can change program behavior if compiled out.

```c
// BAD: Side effect in assertion
assert(x++ > 0); // x is incremented only if assertions are enabled!
```

| Assertion Type   | When Checked   | Can Be Compiled Out? | Example                |
|------------------|---------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| Runtime          | Run-time       | Yes (`-DNDEBUG`)     | `assert(x > 0);`       |
| Static           | Compile-time   | No                   | `static_assert(...);`  |

### Practical Debugging Workflow
Suppose a program crashes with a segmentation fault. A robust workflow:

```
[Start]
  |
  v
[Reproduce Failure]
  |
  v
[Static Checking (compiler, linter)]
  |
  v
[Dynamic Checking (sanitizer, Valgrind, fuzzer)]
  |
  v
[Add Assertions/Logging]
  |
  v
[Trace Error (print/debugger)]
  |
  v
[Fix Bug]
  |
  v
[Retest All Cases]
  |
  v
[End]
```

- **Decision Tree Example:**
  - If bug is a crash: Use sanitizer/Valgrind first.
  - If bug is a logic error: Add assertions and logging.
  - If bug is intermittent: Try ThreadSanitizer or fuzzing.

### Debugging Tool Comparison Table
| Tool/Method      | Detects                | Overhead | Source Needed | Best For                |
|------------------|------------------------|----------|--------------|-------------------------|
| Compiler Warnings| Syntax, types          | None     | Yes          | Early bug detection     |
| Linter           | Style, simple bugs     | None     | Yes          | Code quality            |
| Static Analyzer  | Deep logic             | Low      | Yes          | Complex bugs            |
| Sanitizer        | Memory, UB, races      | Med      | Yes          | Memory/concurrency bugs |
| Valgrind         | Memory, leaks          | High     | No           | Production binaries     |
| Fuzzer           | Crashes, edge cases    | High     | Yes          | Unusual input bugs      |

## 2. Portability Checking
- Ensures code runs correctly on different platforms (OS, architecture, browser, etc.).
- **Examples:**
  - Cross-browser JavaScript testing.
  - Cross-platform compilation (32-bit vs 64-bit).
  - Testing with different OS/browser/plugin combinations.
- **Techniques:**
  - Build and run on multiple environments.
  - Use compiler flags like `-m32` to generate 32-bit binaries.
  - **Feature testing:** Use tools like Autoconf, CMake to check for features, not just OS.

| Flag    | Purpose                             |
|---------|-------------------------------------|
| `-m32`  | Force 32-bit compilation on GCC      |
| default | Typically compiles to 64-bit binary |

- **Note:** Portability checking can be expensive due to the combinatorial explosion of possible environments.
- **Best Practice:** Prefer feature checks over OS checks. Example:
  ```c
  #ifdef HAVE_RENAMEAT2
    // Use renameat2
  #else
    // Fallback
  #endif
  ```

| Approach         | Pros                        | Cons                        |
|------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| OS-based checks  | Simple, direct              | Brittle, not future-proof   |
| Feature checks   | Robust, portable            | More setup, needs tooling   |

## 3. Test Cases
- **Purpose:** Not to prove code works, but to find bugs.
- **Mindset:** "If my test cases didn't find a bug, I failed."
- **Types of tests:**
  - **Unit tests:** Test individual functions/components.
  - **Integration tests:** Test interactions between components.
  - **Regression tests:** Ensure old bugs stay fixed.
  - **Fuzz tests:** Randomized input to find edge cases.
- **Test infrastructure:**
  - Automate test execution (shell scripts, `make check`, CI systems).
  - Run tests in parallel (`make -j N`).
  - Separate quick/cheap tests (run frequently) from heavy/expensive tests (run less often).
- **Tools:**
  - Scripts (e.g., `run_tests.sh`)
  - Makefiles with `check` targets
  - GitHub Actions/CI
- **Test case generation:**
  - LLMs (Large Language Models) are effective for generating test cases (Meta found 40–50% LLM contribution is optimal).
- **Randomness testing:**
  - Impossible to mathematically prove randomness.
  - Can test statistical properties (bit balance, lack of patterns, distribution coverage).
  - Example of a bad random generator that passes naive tests:
    ```c
    return UINT64_MAX / 3; // Alternating bits
    ```
- **Test Coverage:**
  - **Statement coverage:** Every line executed.
  - **Branch coverage:** Every branch taken.
  - **Path coverage:** Every possible path (usually infeasible for large programs).

| Test Type         | Scope         | Detects                |
|-------------------|--------------|------------------------|
| Unit              | Function     | Local logic errors     |
| Integration       | Subsystem    | Interface bugs         |
| Regression        | Whole system | Recurring bugs         |
| Fuzz              | Whole system | Edge cases, crashes    |

## 4. Defensive Programming
- **Goals:**
  - Prevent bugs before they occur.
  - Minimize the impact of bugs that do occur.
  - Detect bugs early and reliably.
- **Techniques:**
  - Static checking (compiler warnings)
  - Dynamic checking (sanitizers, Valgrind)
  - Test case design for failure
  - Defensive coding (asserts, bounds checks)
  - **Input validation:** Always check user input for validity.
  - **Fail-fast:** Abort early on error to avoid propagating bad state.
  - **Error handling patterns:** Return error codes, use exceptions, or error objects as appropriate.

| Defensive Technique | Example/Pattern                | Benefit                        |
|--------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Input validation   | `if (!valid(x)) return -1;`    | Prevents bad data              |
| Assert invariants  | `assert(ptr != NULL);`         | Catches bugs early             |
| Fail-fast          | `exit(1)` on error             | Avoids cascading failures      |
| Error codes        | `return -1;`                   | Explicit error propagation     |
| Exception handling | `try { ... } catch { ... }`    | Structured error management    |

## 5. Terminology: Error, Fault, Failure
| Term     | Description                                         | Real-World Analogy                |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Error    | Developer's mistake (mental/conceptual)             | Forgetting to check tire pressure |
| Fault    | Error reflected in the code (latent bug)            | Flat tire in the car              |
| Failure  | Fault triggered during execution (observable bug)   | Car accident                      |

- **Debugging process:**
  - Start with symptoms (failure), trace back to fault (code), then to error (developer's mistake).

```
[Error: Developer's Mistake]
           |
           v
   [Fault: Bug in Code]
           |
           v
[Failure: Runtime Symptom]
           |
           v
[Debugging: Trace Back]
           |
           v
[Fix: Correct the Error]
```

| Step         | What You See         | What It Means                |
|--------------|---------------------|------------------------------|
| Failure      | Crash, wrong output | Something went wrong         |
| Fault        | Bug in code         | Root cause in implementation |
| Error        | Mental slip         | Design/logic misunderstanding|

## 6. Debugging Best Practices
### 6.1 Steps
1. **Reproduce/Stabilize the failure**
   - Make the bug consistent and repeatable.
   - May require disabling features like ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization).
2. **Locate the fault**
   - Use backwards reasoning from symptoms to code.
   - Use debugger features to narrow down the cause.
3. **Minimize the test case**
   - Reduce input to the smallest case that still triggers the bug.
4. **Form a hypothesis**
   - Based on evidence, guess the root cause.
5. **Test the hypothesis**
   - Change code or add diagnostics to confirm/refute.
6. **Fix and retest**
   - Correct the bug and rerun all tests to ensure the issue is resolved.

```
[Observe Failure]
      |
      v
[Reproduce & Stabilize]
      |
      v
[Minimize Test Case]
      |
      v
[Form Hypothesis]
      |
      v
[Test Hypothesis]
      |
      v
[Fix & Retest]
```

### 6.2 Anti-patterns
- Randomly modifying code lines hoping it works (futile, non-scalable).
- Avoid using GDB as a crutch; it's for reasoning, not fixing.
- Ignoring compiler warnings.
- Not automating tests (manual testing is error-prone).
- Failing to minimize test cases (harder to debug).

### Debugging Checklist
- [ ] Can you reproduce the bug reliably?
- [ ] Have you checked compiler warnings and static analysis?
- [ ] Have you run dynamic tools (sanitizer, Valgrind, fuzzer)?
- [ ] Have you minimized the test case?
- [ ] Do you understand the code path leading to the bug?
- [ ] Have you confirmed the fix with all relevant tests?

## 7. GDB: Debugger Deep Dive
### 7.1 GDB's Role
- GDB is a "Program Execution Explorer."
- GDB controls the debugged process by communicating with the OS kernel.
- Can start a program, attach to a running process, or modify program state.

### 7.2 Key GDB Commands
| Command         | Purpose                                    |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `run` / `r`     | Start the program within GDB               |
| `quit` / `q`    | Exit GDB                                   |
| `attach PID`    | Attach to an already running process       |
| `detach`        | Detach from the debugged process           |

#### Setup Commands
| Command                         | Description                             |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `set cwd /path`                 | Set working directory for debugged proc |
| `set env VAR value`             | Set environment variable                |
| `set disable-randomization off` | Enable ASLR                             |

- **ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization):**
  - Randomizes memory layout to prevent exploits.
  - Hurts reproducibility for debugging.
  - GDB disables ASLR by default for reproducibility.

### 7.3 Breakpoints
| Command             | Description                                      |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `break <loc>` / `b` | Set breakpoint at function or line               |
| `info break` / `ib` | List all breakpoints                             |
| `delete <num>` / `d`| Remove specified breakpoint                      |
| `cond <num> <expr>` | Set condition for breakpoint (advanced)          |

- **Implementation:**
  - GDB replaces the instruction at the breakpoint with a trap instruction.
  - When the program hits the trap, it stops and GDB regains control.
  - **Hardware breakpoints:** Use CPU support, limited in number (e.g., 4 on x86-64).
  - **Software breakpoints:** Unlimited, but slower (require code modification).

### 7.4 Control Commands
| Command         | Action                                                      |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `continue` / `c`| Resume execution after break                               |
| `step` / `s`    | Step into the next line of source code (includes functions)|
| `next` / `n`    | Step over function calls                                   |
| `stepi`         | Step a single machine instruction                          |
| `finish`        | Run until current function returns                         |

- **Note:** Stepping can be confusing with optimized code; use `-O0` and `-g3` for best results.

### 7.5 Advanced Commands
| Command                   | Purpose                                                                    |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `reverse-continue` / `rc` | Execute backwards to previous state (requires special setup, slows down)    |
| `watch <expr>`            | Set a watchpoint to break when expression value changes                     |
| `checkpoint` / `restart`  | Save and reload program state (manual reverse execution)                    |
| `print <expr>` / `p`      | Evaluate and print a variable or expression                                 |
| `define <macro>`          | Define a custom GDB macro (automation)                                      |

- **Reverse execution:**
  - `rc` requires GDB to keep snapshots of program state, which is slow and memory-intensive.
  - `checkpoint`/`restart` is a manual, more efficient alternative.
- **Watchpoints:**
  - Hardware support is limited (e.g., x86-64 supports 4 hardware watchpoints).
  - Software watchpoints are much slower.
- **Conditional breakpoints:**
  - Only break when a condition is true (e.g., `b foo if x == 42`).
- **Macros and scripting:**
  - Automate repetitive tasks with GDB's macro language or Python scripting.
- **Remote debugging:**
  - Debug programs running on another machine (e.g., embedded systems) via network or serial port.

### 7.6 Print Command Usage
- Print variables, expressions, or call functions:
  ```gdb
  p a + b
  p my_struct.member
  p my_function()
  p exit(1)  // Dangerous: will cause program to terminate
  ```

### 7.7 Common GDB Pitfalls and Solutions
| Pitfall                        | Solution/Workaround                        |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Optimized code hard to debug   | Compile with `-O0 -g3`                     |
| Variables "optimized out"      | Use less optimization, check symbol table  |
| Stepping skips lines           | Use `stepi` for instruction-level control  |
| Breakpoints not hit            | Check for inlined/optimized code           |
| Watchpoints not triggering     | Use hardware watchpoints, minimize scope   |

---

**Summary:**
- Use static and dynamic tools together for best coverage.
- Defensive programming and rigorous testing are key to robust code.
- Debugging is a process: observe, reproduce, minimize, hypothesize, test, fix, and retest.
- GDB is powerful, but should be used thoughtfully—not as a crutch.
- Always automate and document your debugging and testing processes.
