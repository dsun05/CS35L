# Lecture 19: Software Security

## 1. Introduction: Why Security Matters

- Security must be considered from the very beginning of software design—not as an afterthought.
- Integrate security into initial specs, requirements, and all stages of development.
- Clients/customers assume developers are building secure systems, even if they don't specify requirements.
- Ignoring security leads to wasted time, insecure architectures, and potentially catastrophic vulnerabilities.
- Security is a major field in practical computing (jobs, internships, real-world impact), second only to AI in scope.
- Even if you don't specialize in security, you must understand the basics to avoid critical mistakes and communicate with specialists.
- **Regulatory/Compliance:** Many industries require security by law (e.g., GDPR for privacy in Europe, HIPAA for healthcare in the US).
- **Real-World Example:**
  - In 2017, the Equifax breach exposed sensitive data of 147 million people due to an unpatched vulnerability, leading to billions in damages and loss of trust.

## 2. Step Zero: Security Mindset

Before you write code, develop two models:

### 2.1 Security Model
- What are you defending? ("Crown jewels"/assets)
- Model the application and its valuable data/resources.
- **CIA Triad:**
  - **Confidentiality (Privacy):** Prevent unauthorized data access/leakage.
  - **Integrity:** Prevent unauthorized modification/tampering.
  - **Availability (Service):** Ensure systems are usable and accessible.

```
+-------------------+
|   Application     |
|-------------------|
| Confidential Data |
+-------------------+
      |   |   |
      v   v   v
 C (no leaks)  I (no tampering)  A (always up)
```

**Example Security Model: Online Banking**
- Assets: Account balances, transaction history, personal info
- Confidentiality: Only account owner and authorized staff can view balances
- Integrity: Only valid transactions can modify balances
- Availability: Users must be able to access accounts 24/7

### 2.2 Threat Model
- Who might attack the system, and how?
- Prioritize defense strategies based on realistic threats.
- Models are never perfect—improve them continuously.

#### Threat Modeling Frameworks
| Framework | Focus | Example Use |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| STRIDE    | Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege | Web apps, APIs |
| DREAD     | Damage, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected Users, Discoverability | Risk ranking |
| PASTA     | Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis | Enterprise systems |

#### Checklist for Security Modeling
| Category        | Purpose                                 | Example                                 |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Assets          | What needs protection                   | Database, config files, credentials     |
| Vulnerabilities | Weaknesses/channels for attack          | Open ports, input flaws, misconfig      |
| Threats         | Potential attackers/scenarios           | Ex-employees, bots, phishing, insiders  |

## 3. Key Security Functions

### 3.1 Authentication
- Verifies user identity.
- Examples: Passwords, two-factor authentication (2FA), USB keys, biometrics (retinal scan, fingerprint).
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA):
  - Something you know (password)
  - Something you have (device, app, USB key)
  - Something you are (biometric)
- **Password Best Practices:**
  - Use long, random passwords (consider passphrases)
  - Never reuse passwords across sites
  - Use a password manager
  - Avoid common pitfalls: security questions, SMS-based 2FA (can be intercepted)

| Method Type         | Description         | Example                |
|---------------------|--------------------|------------------------|
| Something you know  | Knowledge-based    | Password, PIN          |
| Something you have  | Possession-based   | USB key, Duo app, TOTP |
| Something you are   | Biometric          | Fingerprint, retina    |

### 3.2 Authorization
- Dictates what authenticated users can do.
- Example: Instructor can modify grades in their own classes, not others.
- Uses Access Control Lists (ACLs):

| User      | Read | Write | Execute |
|-----------|------|-------|---------|
| Eggert    | Yes  | Yes   | Yes     |
| Milstein  | Yes  | No    | No      |
| Frank     | No   | No    | No      |

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
  - Users are assigned roles (e.g., admin, user, guest), and roles have permissions.
  - Easier to manage than per-user ACLs in large systems.

| Role   | Permissions           |
|--------|----------------------|
| Admin  | Read, Write, Execute |
| User   | Read, Write          |
| Guest  | Read                 |

- **Principle of Least Privilege:**
  - Users/processes should have the minimum access necessary to perform their tasks.
- **Fail-Safe Defaults:**
  - Deny access by default; only allow what is explicitly permitted.

### 3.3 Integrity Mechanisms
- Detect and recover from unauthorized changes.
- Examples: Checksums, secure backups, digital signatures.

| Mechanism      | Description                                 |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Checksums      | Detect tampering by comparing stored values |
| Backups        | Restore data after compromise/loss          |
| Digital Sig.   | Verify authenticity and integrity           |

### 3.4 Auditing
- Logs user actions to detect/recover from intrusions.
- Logs must be secure, complete, and regularly reviewed.
- **What to Log:**
  - Logins (success/failure), privilege changes, data access, configuration changes, errors.
  - Protect logs from tampering (write-once, append-only storage).

### 3.5 Supporting Principles
| Principle   | Description                                        |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Correctness | Security must not break core functionality         |
| Efficiency  | Security must not overly degrade performance       |
| Usability   | Security should not make the system unusable       |

## 4. Threat Modeling and Classification

- Classify threats to prioritize and determine effective defenses.

### 4.1 Network Attacks
| Threat                | Description                                                      | Example |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| Phishing              | Tricking users to click links or enter credentials               | Fake bank email asks for password |
| Drive-by Downloads    | Malware triggered by visiting malicious pages                    | Malicious ad installs spyware |
| Denial-of-Service     | Overloading servers to make them unavailable                     | Botnet floods login page |
| Buffer Overruns       | Overflowing memory buffers to hijack control flow                | See code below |
| Cross-Site Scripting  | Malicious JavaScript in user's browser (e.g., bank theft)        | Attacker injects <script> tag |
| Prototype Pollution   | Attacking object prototypes in JavaScript                        | Overwriting __proto__ in JS |

**Buffer Overrun Example (C):**
```c
char buf[8];
gets(buf); // No bounds checking! Attacker can overwrite memory.
```

### 4.2 Device Attacks
| Attack         | Description                                              | Example |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| Bad USB        | USB device boots/installs malware, hijacks boot process  | Malicious USB stick |
| Insider Attack | Authorized users misuse privileges                       | Employee steals data |
| Supply Chain   | Compromise occurs in hardware/software before delivery   | Pre-installed malware on device |

### 4.3 Social Engineering
- Convincing users to reveal info or grant access (e.g., fake repairman, lost ID).
- Hard to defend; requires robust integrity and auditing.
- **Example:** Attacker calls pretending to be IT and asks for your password.

### 4.4 Physical Security
- Physical access can defeat most software security.
- Examples: Stolen laptops, unlocked server rooms, dumpster diving for sensitive documents.

## 5. OWASP Top 10 Application Security Risks (2021)

| #  | Vulnerability                        | Description/Examples                                                      |
|----|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1  | Broken Access Control                | URL/JWT/cookie manipulation, insecure direct object references           |
| 2  | Cryptographic Failures               | HTTP over HTTPS, weak crypto, improper certificate validation            |
| 3  | Injection Attacks                    | SQL/NoSQL/command injection via untrusted input                          |
| 4  | Insecure Design                      | No threat modeling, poor design practices                                |
| 5  | Security Misconfiguration            | Default passwords, open ports, unnecessary services                      |
| 6  | Vulnerable/Outdated Components       | Using libraries/OS with known exploits                                   |
| 7  | Identification/Authentication Failures| Weak passwords, no rate limiting, brute force attacks                    |
| 8  | Software/Data Integrity Failures     | Poor update mechanisms, unverified sources, supply chain attacks         |
| 9  | Security Logging/Monitoring Failures | Lack of logging, logs not reviewed, filled logs                          |
| 10 | Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)   | Tricking server to access internal/private network addresses             |

**Examples:**
- **1. Broken Access Control:** User changes their user ID in the URL to access another user's data.
- **2. Cryptographic Failures:** Site uses HTTP instead of HTTPS, exposing passwords in transit.
- **3. Injection Attacks:** Attacker enters `'; DROP TABLE users;--` in a login form.
- **4. Insecure Design:** No input validation, no threat modeling, no secure defaults.
- **5. Security Misconfiguration:** Admin interface left open to the internet with default password.
- **6. Vulnerable/Outdated Components:** Using an old version of OpenSSL with known bugs.
- **7. Identification/Authentication Failures:** No account lockout after repeated failed logins.
- **8. Software/Data Integrity Failures:** Application updates from untrusted sources.
- **9. Security Logging/Monitoring Failures:** No alert when admin logs in from a new country.
- **10. SSRF:** Attacker tricks server into fetching internal metadata from AWS.

**Clarification:**
- **Broken Access Control** is about users being able to access things they shouldn't (authorization failure).
- **Identification/Authentication Failures** are about not being able to reliably tell who a user is (authentication failure).

## 6. Security Testing: Philosophy and Strategies

### 6.1 Testing Philosophy
| Traditional Testing              | Security Testing                        |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Inputs: typical users            | Inputs: malicious attackers              |
| Failures: random                 | Failures: deliberate, targeted           |
| Bugs: accidental                 | Bugs: systematically exploited           |

### 6.2 Strategies
- **Static Analysis:** Analyze code without running it (find buffer overflows, races, etc.).
- **Dynamic Analysis:** Analyze code while running (finds runtime issues, e.g., memory leaks, race conditions).
- **Penetration Testing:** Hire trusted "black hats" to simulate real-world attacks.
- **Fuzz Testing:** Automatically generate random/malformed inputs to find crashes and vulnerabilities.

| Testing Type      | Description                                 | Example Tool |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------|
| Static Analysis   | Examines code without running it             | Coverity     |
| Dynamic Analysis  | Examines code during execution               | Valgrind     |
| Penetration Test  | Simulated attack by security experts         | Metasploit   |
| Fuzz Testing      | Randomized input to find bugs                | AFL, libFuzzer|

### 6.3 Side-Channel and Timing Attacks
- Attackers infer internal state/data by measuring timing (e.g., cache timing, Spectre, Meltdown).
- Apple restricts high-res timers to inhibit these attacks; Linux allows nanosecond timing (riskier).
- **Example: Timing Attack on Password Check**

```c
// Vulnerable password check
for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    if (input[i] != secret[i]) return 0;
}
return 1;
// Leaks how many bytes are correct via timing
```

- **Countermeasures:**
  - Use constant-time comparison functions
  - Limit timing information available to untrusted code

### 6.4 Subtle Abstraction Violations
- Example: Partial string comparison leaks password byte-by-byte via timing.
- Advanced: Manipulate memory layout, exploit page boundaries, cache access patterns.

```
[User Input] ---> [Password Check]
                |
                +---> [Timing Difference] ---> [Attacker infers secret]
```

## 7. Trusting Trust: Ken Thompson's Attack

- Described in the Turing Award lecture "Reflections on Trusting Trust."
- Modify the C compiler to insert a backdoor when compiling login.c:

```c
if (strcmp(name, "ken") == 0) return true;
```

- Then, modify the compiler to insert this backdoor into any future compiler it compiles.
- Result: Even if you inspect the source code for login.c and cc.c, the executables will still regenerate the backdoor.

```
[Source: login.c] --(buggy cc)--> [login (backdoor)]
[Source: cc.c]    --(buggy cc)--> [cc (backdoor)]
[Source: new cc.c] --(backdoored cc)--> [new cc (backdoor)]
```

- **Modern Implications:**
  - Supply chain attacks in open source: malicious code injected into dependencies, compilers, or build tools.
  - Example: SolarWinds attack (2020) where attackers compromised the build system to insert backdoors.

- **Defense:**
  - Define a **Trusted Computing Base (TCB):** Minimal set of components (compiler, OS, hardware) that must be trusted.
  - Software reproducibility and rigorous review help, but trust must start somewhere.
  - Use reproducible builds and independent verification.

## 8. Summary and Takeaways

- Security must be integrated from the start—never "added later."
- Develop both a security model (what to protect) and a threat model (who/what to defend against).
- The CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) is foundational.
- Key functions: authentication, authorization, integrity, auditing, correctness, efficiency.
- Threats include network, device, social engineering, and insider attacks.
- OWASP Top 10 highlights common vulnerabilities—know and avoid them.
- Security testing is adversarial: expect intelligent, targeted attacks.
- Advanced attacks (timing, side-channel, supply chain, trusting trust) require deep awareness.
- Always think like a defender—and sometimes like an attacker—to build robust, secure software.

**Checklist for Secure Software Development:**
- [ ] Define assets and security requirements
- [ ] Build a security and threat model
- [ ] Apply the principle of least privilege
