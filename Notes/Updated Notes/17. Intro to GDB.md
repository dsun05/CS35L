# Introduction to GDB, Python Classes, and Packaging

## 1. Debugging in GDB

### 1.1 Should We Demo Debugging Tools?
- Discussion on whether live demonstrations of debugging tools (like GDB) should be included in lectures.
- **Pros of demos:**
  - Shows real-time problem-solving and how functions behave in practice.
- **Cons:**
  - Demos take more time and might cover fewer topics.
  - Risk of being dull if not executed well.

### 1.2 GDB Essentials

#### 1.2.1 Stack-Related Commands
| Command | Full Form | Description |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| `i f`   | `info frame` | Shows information about the current function stack frame. |
| `bt` or `i s` | `backtrace` or `info stack` | Lists call stack trace, showing how program arrived at current function. |

- Stack frames record what function called what.
- **Machine-level optimizations** (e.g., tail-call optimization) may cause missing frames in the trace. For example, if a function's last action is to call another, the intermediate frame may be omitted.
- Local variables may be optimized out and hence unavailable in GDB.
- Backtrace only records enough information for the system to continue execution, not every detail of the call history (e.g., loops are not shown).

#### 1.2.2 Conditional Breakpoints
```gdb
b sqrt
condition 27 x < 0
```
- Stops only when a condition is met (e.g., sqrt is called with a negative number).
- Prevents hitting breakpoints unnecessarily.
- Hardware breakpoints can be combined with conditions for efficient debugging.

#### 1.2.3 Advanced Expression Evaluation
- `print expr`: Standard way to evaluate an expression.
- `display expr`: More detailed; can print each step of evaluation.
- GDB allows tooling with Python to customize how structures (like graphs) are displayed.
- You can write Python code to help GDB print complex data structures in a readable way.

#### 1.2.4 Register Inspection
```gdb
i r
p $xmm0
```
- `info registers`: Shows machine register values.
- Useful for performance checks and low-level debugging.
- Registers are fast-access storage; inspecting them can reveal performance-critical code paths.

### 1.3 Remote and Cross-Platform Debugging

#### 1.3.1 Debugging Different Architectures
```gdb
target architecture-name
```
- Allows debugging code meant for different architectures (e.g., ARM, x86-64).
- GDB can debug programs running on a different architecture than the host.

#### 1.3.2 Remote Debugging
- GDB can debug programs running on remote machines via serial ports or network (TCP/IP).
- Useful for embedded systems or IoT devices lacking GDB capabilities natively.
- Requires a copy of the executable on both the host and target machines.
- Configuration may involve specifying architecture and connection details (e.g., SSH, serial port).

### 1.4 GDB Macros and Extensions

#### 1.4.1 GDB Macros
```gdb
define printlook
  print *(long*)0xAAFC08
end
```
- Custom debugging commands.
- `$arg1`, `$arg2`, etc., can be used for parameter substitution.
- GDB has its own macro language for automating repetitive tasks.

#### 1.4.2 Extension Languages
- GDB supports:
  - Its own macro language.
  - Python (powerful and common).
  - Lisp (from Emacs heritage).
- Extension languages allow you to automate and extend GDB's functionality.

### 1.5 Alternative Debugging Strategies

#### 1.5.1 Assertions
C-style:
```c
assert(x >= 0);
```
- If `x < 0`, the program prints error and aborts.
- Can be compiled away using `-DNDEBUG`.
- **Restriction:** Assertions should be free of side effects; otherwise, program behavior may differ when assertions are compiled out.
- Difference from `unreachable`: Assertions are runtime checks; `unreachable` is a message to the compiler about code paths.

| Advantage | Disadvantage |
|-----------|--------------|
| Helps catch bugs early | Assertions with side effects behave unpredictably if compiled out |

#### 1.5.2 Exception Handling
Python-style:
```python
try:
    do_something()
except ZeroDivisionError:
    handle_issue()
```
Alternative C-style:
```c
if (do_something() < 0) {
    handle_issue();
}
```

| Feature | Try-Catch | Manual Checking |
|---------|----------|-----------------|
| Clearer mainline code | Yes | No |
| Easier to track flow | No | Yes |

- **Try-catch**: Mainline code is clearer, but error handling can be less explicit.
- **Manual checking**: Error handling is explicit, but mainline code is cluttered.
- Both have pros and cons; know when to use each.

#### 1.5.3 Logging and Tracing
- Print/log statements to track execution.
- **Logs**: Explicit in code (e.g., print statements, server logs).
- **Traces**: Generated by external tools (e.g., `strace` for Linux, which logs system calls).
- Useful for debugging production systems where attaching a debugger is impractical.

#### 1.5.4 Checkpoint-Restart
- Save application state at intervals.
- On crash, reload checkpoint to reproduce or recover state.
- Useful for reproducing bugs in long-running programs.

#### 1.5.5 Barricades
- Architecture for legacy modernization.
- Build a clean subsystem separated by a "barricade".
- Only allow access via validated interfaces.
- Barricade checks all data crossing from messy to clean code, ensuring reliability.

**Versioned cleanup pattern:**
1. Start with this structure:
```
[Messy Code] --barricade--> [Clean Code]
```
2. Gradually clean messy code and push barricade outward.

**ASCII Diagram: Barricade Pattern**
```
+----------------+    Barricade    +----------------+
|  Messy Legacy  | --------------> |    Clean New   |
|     Code       | <-------------- |     Code       |
+----------------+   (interface)   +----------------+
```
- Only validated data/operations cross the barricade.
- Over time, the barricade moves as more code is cleaned up.

#### 1.5.6 Stronger Isolation Mechanisms
- **Interpreters**: Execute untrusted code through a carefully written interpreter. Slow but safe. Used in Chrome, Emacs, GDB, etc.
- **Virtual Machines and Containers**:
  - Virtual machines emulate entire systems, providing strong isolation.
  - Containers share host OS but isolate user space. Lighter, but less isolated than VMs.
  - Trade-off: Security vs. performance.

## 2. Python Programming Constructs

### 2.1 Functions and Lambdas
```python
f = lambda x, y: x + y + 1
g = f
```
- Functions are first-class callables.
- Can be assigned to other variables.
- Lambda expressions create anonymous functions.

### 2.2 Python Classes and Inheritance

#### 2.2.1 Classes as Objects
- In Python, classes are regular objects.
- Can be dynamically created and assigned.
- Each class has a `__dict__` that stores its attributes (a dictionary mapping names to values).
- `__dict__` is a reserved name; don't modify unless you know what you're doing.

#### 2.2.2 Inheritance Model
```python
class C(A, B):
    ...
```
- Multiple inheritance allowed.
- Python uses **depth-first left-to-right** search for method resolution, avoiding re-visits.
- Different from C++, JavaScript, etc. (each language has its own method resolution order).

### 2.3 Namespaces and Scoping
- Namespace: Collection mapping names to objects (essentially a `dict`).
- Each class, module, and function defines its own namespace.
- Namespaces prevent name collisions and organize code.

## 3. Python Modules and Import System

### 3.1 Basic Module Mechanics
```python
# foo.py
a = 19
def f(x): return x + 1
class C: ...
```
- Modules are Python files (`.py`) that define variables, functions, and classes.
- `import foo` creates a new namespace, executes `foo.py` in that namespace, and binds `foo` in the importer's namespace.
- Use `foo.a` to access `a` from the module.
- **Pitfalls:**
  - Circular imports (A imports B, B imports A) can cause issues; Python tries to avoid re-importing modules.
  - Name collisions: If you already have a variable named `foo`, importing a module with the same name will overwrite it.

#### 3.1.1 Selective Import
```python
from foo import f
```
- Imports only `f` from `foo` into the current namespace.
- `from foo import *` imports all names, but can cause name collisions and is discouraged unless necessary.

#### 3.1.2 Inspecting Modules
- `dir(foo)` lists all names in the module.
- The `builtins` module contains all built-in functions and names.

#### 3.1.3 Running Modules as Scripts
- Running `python foo.py` creates a new namespace and sets `__name__` to `__main__`.
- Common idiom:
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # test code or main application
```
- Allows modules to be used both as importable libraries and as standalone scripts.

---

### 3.2 Packages and Hierarchical Organization
- Packages are directories containing an `__init__.py` file.
- Packages allow hierarchical organization of modules (tree structure).
- Dots in import names correspond to directory structure (e.g., `import a.b.c` looks for `a/b/c.py`).
- `__init__.py` can perform package-level initialization.
- Relative imports (e.g., `from . import foo`) allow navigation within the package hierarchy.

**ASCII Diagram: Python Package/Module Hierarchy**
```
my_app/
├── __init__.py
├── utils/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── math_helpers.py
└── models/
    ├── __init__.py
    └── user.py
```
- Each directory with `__init__.py` is a package.
- Modules are `.py` files within packages.

#### 3.2.1 Multiple Libraries
- Python searches for modules using the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable (colon-separated list of directories).
- The `import` statement searches these directories in order.

#### 3.2.2 Package Managers
- **pip**: Python's package manager for installing, upgrading, and removing packages.
  - `pip install numpy` installs the NumPy library.
  - `pip uninstall numpy` removes it.
  - `pip list` shows installed packages.
  - `pip list --outdated` shows outdated packages.
  - `pip list --format=json` outputs in JSON format.
- **Dependencies:** pip installs dependencies automatically, but this can sometimes pull in unwanted packages.
- **Extending Python:** Most extensions are done via libraries, but you can also modify the Python interpreter itself (written in C) for deeper changes. Such changes are proposed via Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs).
- **Virtual environments**: Tools like `venv` or `virtualenv` allow you to create isolated Python environments, modifying the `PYTHONPATH` for project-specific dependencies.

#### 3.2.3 Comparison to Other Ecosystems
- Node.js uses `npm` for package management; similar issues and workflows as Python's `pip`.

## 4. Build Tools and Packaging for Compiled Languages (Preview)
- Building and packaging for compiled languages (C, C++, Rust) is more complex than for interpreted languages.
- Executables are platform-specific; even machines with the same architecture may have subtle differences.
- The build/distribution/install process involves multiple roles:
  - **Developers**: Write the code.
  - **Builders**: Compile the code.
  - **Distributors**: Ship executables to users.
  - **Installers**: Install executables on end-user machines.
- Simple scripts can automate builds, but more robust tools are needed for complex projects.
- This topic will be continued in the next lecture.

**ASCII Diagram: Build Process Stakeholder Flow**
```
[Developer]
     |
     v
[Builder]
     |
     v
[Distributor]
     |
     v
[Installer]
     |
     v
[End User]
```
- Each role may be automated or manual.
- Artifacts flow from source code to executable to installed application.
