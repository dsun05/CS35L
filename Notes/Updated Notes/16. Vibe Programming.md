# Lecture 16: Vibe Programming and AI-Driven Software Development

## 1. Introduction: Vibe Programming Overview
- Guest lecture by Prof. Kerry Nachenberg, with a demonstration-based format and live coding.
- Focus: Vibe Programming—AI-assisted software development, current capabilities, and workflows of AI agents in software construction.

## 2. What is Vibe Programming?

### 2.1 Definition and Origin
- Term coined by Andrej Karpathy (AI expert).
- Karpathy's description:
  > "Fully give into the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists."
- ChatGPT-3 definition:
  > "An informal AI-assisted approach where you prototype by chatting with a model, iterating code, tweaking prompts, and following intuition instead of detailed upfront specs."
- Aspirational: True "vibe" programming is not fully realized yet; debugging and requirements are still necessary.

### 2.2 "Embrace Exponentials"
- AI capabilities are improving at an exponential rate.
- Example: LLMs can now complete hour-long human tasks with much greater success than before; progress doubles roughly every 7 months.

## 3. The Spectrum of Vibe Programming

| Phase               | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| LLM Assistance      | Use AI for small tasks (e.g., generating functions or boilerplate code).     |
| Collaboration       | Human and AI co-develop; AI handles sections, humans debug and integrate.    |
| Full AI Generation  | AI builds complete applications without human-written code (e.g., Pac-Man).  |

- Real-world adoption: Y Combinator reports 20% of teams use AI for most of their product, with 95% of code written by AI in some startups.
- Most effective today: Collaboration, not full AI generation.

## 4. Tools of Vibe Programming

### 4.1 Cursor (Modified VS Code)
- IDE based on VS Code, optimized for AI-assistance.
- Supports multi-file projects, shell access, testing integration.
- Eliminates manual file management (no more copy-pasting from ChatGPT).

### 4.2 Other Tools
- Claude Code
- Codex (OpenAI)
- Google's Gemini

### 4.3 Tool Selection Guidance
- Use ChatGPT for one-off scripts or simple files.
- Use Cursor or similar AI IDEs for moderately complex or multi-file projects.

---

## 5. Understanding Agentic AI

### 5.1 What is an Agent?
- A software system that couples:
  - An LLM (e.g., GPT-4, Claude)
  - A Tool/API Layer (e.g., filesystem, shell, calendar, process execution)
- Agents interpret LLM output (often JSON commands) and execute actions in the real world.

### 5.2 Components in Agentic Framework
1. **Client (IDE):** Cursor (VS Code fork); interfaces with local files/shell.
2. **Backend Server:** Hosted by Cursor to enrich/route prompts and manage command schemas.
3. **LLM:** External model (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic) used to generate commands and logic.

### 5.3 Agent Commands (Examples)

| Action                | Command Format (JSON-like)                                                      |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Google Search         | { "command": "search", "query": "what is pathfinding?" }                      |
| Read From File        | { "command": "read_file", "path": "src/main.ts" }                             |
| Write File            | { "command": "write_file", "path": "game.ts", "data": "..."}                 |
| Execute Shell Command | { "command": "shell", "cmd": "npm start"}                                     |
| Display Message       | { "command": "message", "text": "Task completed successfully!"}               |

- Agentic frameworks use a protocol (e.g., MCP) to standardize these commands.

---

## 6. Agentic Workflow Architecture

### 6.1 Flow of Execution
1. User issues a command (e.g., "Fix bug in foo").
2. Sent to backend server, which appends available command schemas.
3. Prompt sent to LLM.
4. LLM returns a command (e.g., read a file).
5. Backend interprets and executes the command via client.
6. Feedback (e.g., file contents) appended to prompt.
7. Repeat until desired output is attained.

### 6.2 Prompt Management
- Every interaction builds on prior ones; context accumulates.
- Accumulated context can confuse the model ("crud accretes").
- Solution: Re-initialize sessions regularly to avoid confusion.

     ^                 |                    |                |
     |                 |<-------------------|<---------------|
     |                 |   (context, files, |   (commands,   |
     |                 |    feedback, etc.) |    responses)  |
     |                 +-------------------------------------+
     |                        (context accumulates)
     +------------------------------------------------------+
```

## 7. Key Concepts Before Starting Vibe Programming

### 7.1 Coding Rules Configuration
- Specify constraints and style guidelines for the LLM.
- Examples:
  - Reuse/refactor existing code when possible.
  - Do not introduce new frameworks/technologies without confirmation.
  - Make minimal required changes.
- These rules are included in the prompt for every request.

### 7.2 Requirements Gathering
- Essential for successful Vibe Programming, especially for complex projects.

#### Table: Requirements Gathering Components
| Component            | Description                                      |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Functional Req.      | What the software must do (UI, game physics, etc.)|
| User Stories         | How users interact with the system                |
| Framework/API Info   | Preferred tech stack                              |
| UI Mockups           | Visual layouts, wireframes, Figma diagrams        |
| Business Rules       | Backend logic and constraints                     |
| Testing Requirements | How the code is tested (unit tests, etc.)         |
| Performance/Security | Runtime and safety expectations                   |
| Acceptance Criteria  | Success conditions for tasks/project              |

## 8. Demonstration Project: 3-Player Pong Game in TypeScript

### 8.1 Process Overview
1. **PRD Generation (Product Requirements Document):**
   - Formal structure: purpose, features, scope, stretch goals.
   - Can be generated by GPT using a task description.
2. **Dependency-Aware Task List:**
   - Created from PRD; includes ordered and split sub-tasks.
   - Example tasks: setup project, create main loop, paddle class, ball class, input handling, collision detection.
3. **Implementation using Cursor:**
   - Tasks executed in order via automated prompting.
   - Human triggers one task at a time; Cursor performs file creation, code generation, package installation, UI/gameplay updates.

### 8.2 Implementation Details
- Each task is executed in a fresh chat session to avoid context confusion.
- If a task goes "off the rails" (e.g., major bugs, wrong language/framework), revert to last checkpoint and try again.
- Validate each step by running the code and checking results.
- Use diagnostics/logging and model switching for debugging.

#### ASCII Diagram: Task Execution Loop
```
[Start Task] -> [Fresh Chat] -> [Model Executes Task] -> [Validate Output]
      ^                                                  |
      |                                                  v
[If Off Rails: Revert] <------------------------ [If Bug: Debug/Retry]
```

## 9. Debugging with Vibe Programming

### 9.1 Bugs and Failures
- "Off-rails": Non-functional or highly illogical generations.
- Partial bugs: Small issues amidst working components.

### 9.2 Debugging Procedure
1. Start a clean chat session.
2. Clearly describe the issue.
3. Ask for multiple root cause suggestions (not just one).
4. Add diagnostics (e.g., logging) as suggested.
5. Run the program and gather output/logs.
6. Request a targeted fix based on new information.
7. If the fix fails, revert to checkpoint and/or try a different model.

#### Table: Debugging Workflow
| Step | Action                                 | Purpose                                  |
|------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Start clean chat session               | Avoid context confusion                  |
| 2    | Describe the issue                     | Give the model clear context             |
| 3    | Ask for multiple root causes           | Get a range of hypotheses                |
| 4    | Add diagnostics/logging                | Gather more information                  |
| 5    | Run and collect output                 | Provide evidence for next step           |
| 6    | Request targeted fix                   | Focus on the actual problem              |
| 7    | Revert/try different model if needed   | Avoid compounding errors                 |

### 9.3 Debugging Strategies
- Avoid "fix on top of fix"; revert instead.
- Use diagnostics to iteratively narrow down the issue.
- Try different LLMs (Claude, Gemini, etc.) for fresh perspectives.
- Use revert/restore for checkpointing.

## 10. Pro Tips for Effective Vibe Programming

| Tip                                         | Explanation                                                                                 |
|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Use Correct Language and Platform            | AI performs best in familiar environments (e.g., TypeScript for web, Python for ML).        |
| Add Tests to Requirements                    | Guides AI to generate better, verifiable code.                                              |
| Avoid Fixes on Fixes                         | Causes accumulation of errors; revert instead.                                              |
| Paste API Docs                               | Enables LLM to better call external services reliably.                                      |
| Ask for Refactoring                          | AI can improve and clean up code it has previously written.                                 |

- Choose the right language/platform for the task (e.g., TypeScript for games, Python for ML).
- Add testing requirements to ensure code is verifiable and self-debugging.
- Paste API documentation directly into the project for better integration.
- Ask for code refactoring to improve maintainability and reduce duplication.

## 11. Future of AI in Software Development

### 11.1 Job Market Perspective
- AI can't fully replace human intuition, system design, or novel reasoning (yet).
- Developer roles may shift from writing to orchestrating and reviewing code.
- Increasing importance of product thinking: defining requirements clearly.
- Collaboration, not handoff: AI is a tool, not a replacement.
- **Q&A Insight:** The future of software jobs is not "no code" or "all code"—it's a blend. Not using AI is a disadvantage, but over-reliance leads to poor code quality. Human review and understanding remain essential.
- **Domain expertise** is critical for security and correctness. Use AI for productivity, but always review and understand the output, especially for security-sensitive or complex systems.

### 11.2 Educational Use
- Ideal for learning/understanding concepts and debugging unfamiliar code.
- Over-dependence can hinder foundational coding skill development.
- Use AI to explain code and concepts, not just to generate code.
- **Advice:** Use AI to help understand, not just to code. For learning, generate code with AI, then ask for line-by-line explanations to build intuition.
- **Warning:** Studies show that using AI for code completion can hurt learning and intuition if overused. Use it to supplement, not replace, your own problem-solving.

## 12. Empirical Data on AI in Software Development (Dr. Eggert's Segment)

### 12.1 JetBrains 2024 Developer Survey
- 63% of developers save less than 4 hours/week using AI tools (10% productivity boost for a 40-hour week).
- Main benefits: less time searching, faster coding, easier repetitive tasks.

### 12.2 Meta / Satya Nadella Observations
- Microsoft: 20–30% of repo code is AI-generated; Meta aims for >50%.
- Meta's internal study: AI involvement from 10% to 80% of code; lowest bug rates at 40–50% AI involvement.
- AI excels at:
  - Boilerplate/framework code
  - Large-scale refactoring
  - Migration scaffolds
  - Test case generation
- AI struggles with:
  - Complex logic paths
  - Context-heavy features
  - Real systems thinking/architecture
  - Stateful or edge-case-heavy code

#### Table: AI Strengths and Weaknesses

### 12.3 Key Concerns
| Concern                         | Explanation                                                  |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Privacy & Data Leakage          | Risk of sending proprietary code to external models.         |
| IP Ownership                    | Who owns AI-generated code?                                  |
| Maintenance Complexity          | Large, AI-written codebases may be harder to maintain.       |
| Security Vulnerabilities        | Risk of inserting exploitable code (e.g., SQL injection).    |
| Data Poisoning Risk             | Adversarial inputs training the AI to produce backdoors.     |

- **Additional issues:**
  - Leakage of private information (e.g., medical/student data, company secrets, student grades). Use private/incognito modes if available.
  - Unclear IP/copyright status of AI-generated code. Legal landscape is evolving; be cautious with proprietary or commercial projects.
  - Maintenance and operational costs may increase with AI-generated code due to bloat or lack of documentation.
  - Security: AI may generate insecure code, especially if trained on bad examples or adversarial code. Use a second model to review for vulnerabilities.
  - **Data poisoning:** Malicious actors could publish insecure code to "poison" AI training data, leading to vulnerabilities in generated code.

## 13. Summary

This lecture explored the evolving paradigm of Vibe Programming—a method of AI-assisted software development that leverages large language models and integrated agentic systems to generate and manage code. The concept, introduced by Andrej Karpathy, is built on a spectrum from simple LLM assistance to full AI-driven codebases. The lecture emphasized the importance of clear requirements, tooling like Cursor for agentic workflows, and formalized processes such as PRD and dependency-aware task lists.

It provided a deep dive into the architecture of agentic AI, demonstrating how JSON-based command exchanges between user, server, and model guide automated code generation and problem-solving within development environments. Debugging strategies, coding rules, and requirement gathering were also covered, showing how developers can maximize AI's utility while avoiding pitfalls like hallucinations, model confusion, and inappropriate code rewrites.

The session concluded with insights into the current and future job market implications, security risks, and empirical observations on AI effectiveness, suggesting that while AI tools are improving developer productivity, human oversight and understanding remain indispensable for building robust and secure systems.

**Final Takeaways:**
- Use AI as a collaborator, not a replacement.
- Always review, test, and understand AI-generated code, especially for security and correctness.
- Clear requirements and domain expertise are more important than ever.
- The legal, educational, and security landscape is rapidly evolving—stay informed and cautious.
