## 1. Introduction

This lecture covers foundational topics in distributed computing, focusing on:
- Client-server models
- Introduction to Node.js
- Event-driven programming
- Performance and reliability in networked systems
- Comparative discussion of distributed computing architectures
- Historical context: from circuit switching to packet switching

---

## 2. Client-Server Architecture

### Overview

A client-server model is a fundamental pattern in distributed systems where:
- A **server** hosts resources or services (e.g., databases)
- A **client** requests access to those services

### Key Properties
- The application logic is split between client and server
- Runs over a network (often visualized as a line or cloud)
- The server maintains the authoritative state of the system
- The client acts as an interface, with little or no authoritative state

### Real-World Example: Course Enrollment
- The server (e.g., registrar's database) stores the true state (who is enrolled)
- The client (e.g., your laptop/browser) only requests changes or queries state
- Only the server can authoritatively say if you are enrolled

### Multiple Clients, Server as Mediator
- Many clients can exist simultaneously
- Clients communicate only with the server, not directly with each other
- Example: Two students try to enroll at the same time
  - The server must resolve the conflict (pick a winner, reject both, or—if buggy—accept both)

```
Client1
   \
    \
    [Network] — [Server]
    /
   /
Client2
```

### What Can Go Wrong?
- New types of bugs: race conditions, state conflicts, server bottlenecks
- Server is a single point of failure
- Scaling issues as the number of clients grows
- **Network partition:** Clients may be unable to reach the server, causing split-brain or stale state
- **Server crash:** All clients lose access to the service

#### Failure Scenario Diagram
```
Client1   Client2
   \      /
    [Network]   [Server] (down)
         X
```

### Model Comparison Table
| Model         | Centralized? | Fault Tolerance | Scalability | Consistency | Example Use Case         |
|---------------|--------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|-------------------------|
| Client-Server | Yes          | Low             | Moderate    | Strong      | Web apps, databases     |
| P2P           | No           | High            | High        | Weak/Varies | File sharing, BitTorrent|
| Master-Worker | Partial      | Moderate        | High        | Strong      | ML training, MapReduce  |

## 3. Event-Driven Programming

### Definition
A programming paradigm where code responds to asynchronous events (e.g., web requests, file completions, database responses).

### Synchronous vs. Event-Driven
| Synchronous Program | Event-Driven Program |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| Linear execution    | Loops + Handlers     |
| Blocking I/O        | Non-blocking I/O     |

### The Event Loop
A core concept in environments like Node.js:
```javascript
while (true) {
  event = getNextEvent();
  handleEvent(event);
}
```

#### Step-by-Step Event Loop (ASCII)
```
[Event Queue] -> [Event Loop] -> [Handler] -> [Done]
     ^                                 |
     |_________________________________|
```

### Real-World Analogy: Restaurant Order System
- The chef (event loop) handles one order (event) at a time, quickly moving to the next as soon as possible. If a dish takes too long, the kitchen (server) gets backed up.

```
[Order Queue] -> [Chef] -> [Serve Dish]
     ^                        |
     |________________________|
```

### Constraints of Event Handlers
- Must be **fast** (microseconds to a few milliseconds)
- **Never block** (no synchronous file or network reads/writes)
- Blocking causes delays, queued requests, and unresponsiveness

#### Bad Example (Blocking):
```javascript
function handleEvent() {
  const result = readBigFileSync(); // BAD: blocks event loop!
}
```

#### Good Strategy (Non-blocking):
- Split long tasks into short, fast handlers
- Schedule continuation via next event trigger

Example:
```javascript
function doOne(i) {
   doHeavyTask(i);
   scheduleNext(() => doOne(i+1));
}
```

#### Callback Hell Example
```javascript
readFile('a.txt', (err, dataA) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  readFile('b.txt', (err, dataB) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    readFile('c.txt', (err, dataC) => {
      // ...
    });
  });
});
```

#### Solution: Promises/Async-Await
```javascript
async function readFiles() {
  const dataA = await readFileAsync('a.txt');
  const dataB = await readFileAsync('b.txt');
  const dataC = await readFileAsync('c.txt');
}
```

### Problems in Event-Driven Code
- Higher overhead per action (event dispatch, handler setup)
- Error handling is more complex (no exceptions across events)
- Loss of execution order (events may be handled out of order)
- Debugging and reasoning can be difficult

### Multi-threading vs. Event-Driven
| Feature              | Event-Driven             | Multi-threading           |
|----------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| Concurrency Model    | Single-threaded, non-blocking | Multiple threads, context switching |
| Shared State         | No (single thread = no races) | Yes (needs locks to avoid races) |
| Performance Potential| Limited CPU parallelism  | High parallel performance |
| Safety               | No race conditions       | Race conditions possible  |
| Complexity           | Moderate                 | High (synchronization)    |

#### Key Benefit of Event-Driven
- No need for locks
- Less prone to race conditions

#### Limitations
- No true parallelism (one core at a time)
- If an event handler crashes or loops, the whole system halts
- Not suitable for adversarial or untrusted code

#### Other Languages
- Ruby: EventMachine
- Python: Twisted, asyncio (non-blocking I/O)

#### Error Handling in Event-Driven Code
- Error handling is more complex than in synchronous code.
- No exception propagation across events: if an event handler fails, you must explicitly record the error state for future handlers to check.
- You cannot rely on try/catch to propagate errors between events.
- Engineering mindset: always ask "what can go wrong?" and plan for error cases.
- In practice, much of robust software engineering is about anticipating and handling errors.

## 4. Web Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the DOM

### HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
- Describes the structure and content of web pages (declarative).
- Elements are organized in a tree structure (the DOM: Document Object Model).
- Elements can have attributes (name-value pairs) and can be normal, raw text, or void (self-closing).
- HTML is forgiving: browsers try to render as much as possible even with errors.

#### DOM Tree Example
```
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <p>World</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

### CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
- Describes the presentation (style) of HTML elements.
- Styles can be inherited and cascade through the DOM tree.
- Separation of content (HTML) and style (CSS) improves accessibility and maintainability.
- Multiple sources of styles: browser defaults, user preferences, author styles; priority rules determine which wins.

### JavaScript
- Imperative programming language for dynamic behavior in web pages.
- Can manipulate the DOM, respond to events, and update content dynamically.
- Can be included inline or as external files.
- Modern web apps often use JavaScript frameworks (e.g., React, which uses JSX as a declarative extension for UI).

### Declarative vs. Imperative
- HTML and CSS are declarative: describe what you want, not how to do it.
- JavaScript is imperative: describes how to perform actions.
- Good web design separates content, style, and behavior.

### Data Exchange: JSON vs. XML
| Feature      | JSON                        | XML                        |
|--------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|
| Syntax       | Lightweight, concise        | Verbose, tag-based         |
| Readability  | Easy for humans/machines    | Harder for humans          |
| Data Types   | Objects, arrays, numbers    | Text, attributes, elements |
| Use Cases    | Web APIs, config, storage   | Legacy systems, documents  |
| Comments     | Not supported               | Supported                  |

- JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is now the most common format for client-server data exchange (tree-structured, easy for JavaScript).
- XML is more verbose and less common in modern web apps.

#### Security Issues in Web Technologies
- **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):** Malicious scripts injected into web pages.
- **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):** Controls which domains can access resources.
- **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** Tricks users into submitting unwanted actions.

## 5. Writing a Basic Node.js Web Server

### Example Code
```javascript
const http = require('http');
const ip = '127.0.0.1';
const port = 3000;

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.statusCode = 200;
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
  res.end('Hello CS35L World\n');
});

server.listen(port, ip, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://${ip}:${port}/`);
});
```

### Explanation
| Line | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| 1 | Load the HTTP module |
| 2 | Set the local IP address |
| 3 | Define the port number |
| 5–9 | Set up request handler (callback) |
| 10–12 | Start the server and define startup callback |

- `require('http')`: Loads the HTTP module (can be named anything, but conventionally matches the module name)
- `ip = '127.0.0.1'`: Localhost IP; server only accessible from the same machine
- `port = 3000`: Port number (no distinction between integers and floats in JS)
- `http.createServer(...)`: Sets up a server with a callback for each request
- Callback parameters: `req` (request object), `res` (response object)
- `res.statusCode = 200`: HTTP status code (200 = OK)
- `res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain')`: Sets response header
- `res.end('Hello CS35L World\n')`: Ends response, sends data
- `server.listen(...)`: Starts server, with a callback for when it is ready
- Template literals (backticks) allow variable interpolation: `` `Server running at http://${ip}:${port}/` ``

#### Request Flow Diagram
```
[Client] -> [Request] -> [Node.js Server] -> [Handler] -> [Response] -> [Client]
```

#### What if the Server Blocks?
- If a synchronous/blocking call is made in the handler, all incoming requests are delayed until it finishes.
- This can make the server unresponsive and is a common pitfall in Node.js.

#### Demo
- Run: `node app.js`
- Access: `http://localhost:3000`
- Response: "Hello CS35L World"

## 6. Distributed Computing Models

### 1. Client-Server Model
- Centralized control and data
- Problems: scalability, single point of failure
- Example: Traditional web applications

### 2. Peer-to-Peer (P2P)
- Each peer has its own data and control
- No centralized server
- Pros: scalable, redundancy
- Cons: complex consistency, data propagation challenges
- Example: BitTorrent, blockchain

### 3. Primary-Secondary (Master-Worker)
- One primary/master controls computation
- Many secondary/worker nodes perform tasks
- Used in ML training, distributed databases
- Example: MapReduce, parameter servers in ML

| Model         | Use Case              | Pros      | Cons                | Fault Tolerance | Consistency |
|---------------|----------------------|-----------|---------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Client-Server | Web apps, DBs        | Simple    | Scalability, SPOF   | Low             | Strong      |
| P2P           | File sharing, crypto | Scalable  | Complexity          | High            | Weak/Varies |
| Master-Worker | ML, batch jobs       | Control   | Bottleneck at primary| Moderate        | Strong      |

#### ASCII Diagrams

**Client-Server:**
```
Client1   Client2   Client3
   \        |        /
    \       |       /
     [Network]---[Server]
```

**Peer-to-Peer:**
```
[Peer1]---[Peer2]
   |        |
[Peer3]---[Peer4]
```

**Primary-Secondary:**
```
         [Primary]
         /   |   \
   [Sec1] [Sec2] [Sec3]
```

## 7. Distributed Systems Challenges

### A. Performance Problems

#### Throughput
- Number of operations per second
- Optimization methods:
  - Handle events out-of-order
  - Prioritize cached contents
  - Balance workload

#### Latency
- Time between request and response
- Optimization methods:
  - Cache on client (or server)
  - Use faster protocols
  - Reduce payload sizes

##### Example: Browser Cache
- Caches previously fetched results
- Avoids round trips to server (especially important for distant servers)

### B. Correctness Problems

#### Serialization (Expanded)
- Serialization means the system's behavior can be explained as if all actions happened in some serial order, even if they were actually interleaved or out of order.
- This is not a cure-all: the resulting computation must still be valid (e.g., not exceeding enrollment limits).
- Serialization is a way to justify out-of-order or parallel execution as long as the end result matches some valid serial order.
- If your application is buggy, serialization won't save you; it's a tool for reasoning about correctness, not a fix for logic errors.
- Example: In a bank, if you deposit and then withdraw, the system must not reorder these in a way that causes an overdraft fee if you had enough money.
- For a single client, actions should appear in the order they were issued; for multiple clients, the system can justify the result as if some serial order occurred.

#### Cache Staleness
- Client caches may become stale
- Solutions:
  1. **Validate cache**: Compare a unique server state ID (e.g., UUID) with the client cache; if mismatched, update
  2. **Tolerate staleness**: If the application can handle slightly outdated data (e.g., video games, weather apps)

| Condition                   | Strategy                    |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Cache critical              | Validate with server        |
| Cache negligible (e.g., news)| Ignore freshness slightly  |

### C. CAP Theorem
- States that a distributed system can only guarantee two out of three: **Consistency**, **Availability**, **Partition Tolerance**.
- **Consistency:** Every read receives the most recent write or an error.
- **Availability:** Every request receives a (non-error) response, without guarantee that it contains the most recent write.
- **Partition Tolerance:** The system continues to operate despite network partitions.

| Property           | Description                                      |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Consistency        | All nodes see the same data at the same time      |
| Availability       | Every request gets a response (no error)          |
| Partition Tolerance| System works even if network is split             |

#### CAP Theorem Diagram
```
      Consistency
         /   \
        /     \
       /       \
Availability---Partition Tolerance
```
- In practice, systems must choose which two to prioritize during a partition.

### D. Consistency Models
- **Strong Consistency:** All clients see the same data at the same time after a write.
- **Eventual Consistency:** All clients will eventually see the same data, but not immediately.
- **Causal Consistency:** Writes that are causally related are seen by all processes in the same order.

| Model               | Guarantees                | Example Use Case         |
|---------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|
| Strong Consistency  | Immediate, global        | Banking, transactions   |
| Eventual Consistency| Eventually, not instant  | DNS, social feeds       |
| Causal Consistency  | Order of related events  | Collaborative editing   |

## 8. Deep Dive: Legacy Network Technology

### Circuit Switching Model
- Used in traditional (1960s–1980s) telephone systems
- Mechanism: A **dedicated communication path** is established for each call
- Strengths: Guaranteed bandwidth, efficient for long stable conversations, high reliability
- Problems: Inefficient (wastes bandwidth), poor scalability, prone to failure if any intermediate node fails, no encryption (security by trust), motivated by Cold War defense needs

```
Phone A → Central Office → [Switch Network] → Central Office B → Phone B
```

- If any wire or node fails, the whole circuit is lost
- Inefficient: most of the time, the line is silent but still reserved
- Not mobile or portable
- Security: only as strong as the trust in the phone company
- Motivated the search for more robust, scalable, and survivable systems (e.g., in case of nuclear war)

---

## 9. Packet Switching (Modern Networks)

### Overview
- Backbone of the modern Internet
- Data is split into **packets** (typically ~1000 bytes)
- Each packet routes independently via routers
- Routers make independent decisions for each packet
- If a node fails, packets are rerouted
- No need to reserve a full path; more efficient and resilient

```
[UCLA]--[Router]--[Phoenix]--[Chicago]--[Boston]
   \_________________________/
         (alternate path)
```

### Key Terminology
| Term     | Explanation                     |
|----------|---------------------------------|
| Packet   | A bundle of data (≤1500 bytes)  |
| Router   | Device routing packets          |
| IP       | Internet Protocol               |
| Hop      | Transition to next router       |

- Packets may arrive out of order; the receiver must reassemble them
- Routers use heartbeats or other mechanisms to detect failed nodes

### Protocol Layers (The Internet Stack)

The modern Internet is built on a layered protocol stack:

```
+---------------------+
| Application Layer   |  (e.g., HTTP, Zoom, Email)
+---------------------+
| Transport Layer     |  (e.g., TCP, UDP, QUIC)
+---------------------+
| Internet Layer      |  (e.g., IP)
+---------------------+
| Link Layer          |  (e.g., Ethernet, Wi-Fi)
+---------------------+
```

- **Link Layer:** Handles direct connections between devices (e.g., Ethernet, Wi-Fi).
- **Internet Layer:** Handles routing of packets across networks (IP addresses, best-effort delivery, packets may be lost, duplicated, or reordered).
- **Transport Layer:** Provides end-to-end communication (TCP: reliable, ordered, error-checked; UDP: fast, unreliable, unordered; QUIC: modern, supports streams, used in HTTP/3).
- **Application Layer:** Protocols for specific applications (web, email, video, etc.).

#### Motivation for Packet Switching
- Developed for resilience (e.g., Cold War, Paul Baran at RAND): if nodes are destroyed, packets can be rerouted.
- No need to reserve a dedicated path; more efficient and robust than circuit switching.
- Each packet is routed independently; packets may arrive out of order and must be reassembled by the receiver.
- Routers use heartbeats to detect failed nodes and reroute traffic.

#### Real-World Implications
- TCP provides reliability, ordering, and error checking, but can cause "head-of-line blocking" (all subsequent data waits for a lost packet to be retransmitted).
- UDP is used for applications that can tolerate loss (e.g., video, voice, sensor data).
- HTTP/3 and QUIC are designed to avoid head-of-line blocking and improve performance for real-time applications (e.g., video conferencing in browsers).
- Protocols are layered: each layer builds on the services of the one below.

#### Circuit vs. Packet Switching Table
| Feature         | Circuit Switching         | Packet Switching           |
|-----------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| Path            | Dedicated, reserved      | Dynamic, per-packet        |
| Failure Impact  | Call dropped             | Packets rerouted           |
| Efficiency      | Low (idle time wasted)   | High (shared bandwidth)    |
| Scalability     | Poor                     | Excellent                  |
| Security        | Trust-based              | Encryption possible        |

## 10. Conclusion & Key Takeaways
- Event-driven programming requires a different mindset: focus on performance **and** correctness
- Node.js enables scalable, single-threaded network apps
- Client-server is the dominant model, but alternatives (P2P, master-worker) exist and are important
- Performance tuning (latency, throughput) involves caching, async logic, and distributing load
- Serialization and cache validation are key to correctness
- Circuit switching vs. packet switching: understanding the evolution of network infrastructure
- CAP theorem and consistency models are central to distributed system design

---

## 11. Security and the Engineering Mindset

- Security is a major concern in distributed systems, but is often omitted in basic discussions. Always consider security implications (e.g., trust, encryption, adversaries).
- Engineering mindset: Always ask "what can go wrong?" and plan for failures, scaling, and adversarial conditions. Design for reliability, correctness, and performance.
- "Problems of success": Plan for scaling up if your system becomes popular.

### Common Security Threats
| Threat                  | Description                                      | Mitigation                        |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Man-in-the-middle (MITM)| Attacker intercepts/modifies traffic             | Use TLS/SSL encryption            |
| DDoS                    | Overwhelm server with traffic                    | Rate limiting, filtering, scaling |
| XSS                     | Inject malicious scripts into web pages          | Input validation, CSP             |
| CSRF                    | Trick user into unwanted actions                 | Tokens, same-site cookies         |
| Data Breach             | Unauthorized data access                         | Access controls, encryption       |
