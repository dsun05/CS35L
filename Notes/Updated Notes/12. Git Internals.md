# Lecture 12: Git Internals and Advanced Features

## Git as an Object-Oriented Database

- At its core, Git manages your project history as an object-oriented database.
- Every file, directory, and commit is stored as an object, each with a unique SHA-1 checksum as its identifier.
- This object database persists on disk, ensuring your history is safe even if you lose power or close your editor.
- The structure is similar to object-oriented programming, but the objects are stored in files on disk, not in RAM.
- This design enables Git to efficiently store, retrieve, and share complete project histories, and is a key reason for its power and flexibility.

### Table: Git Object Types
| Type   | Description                                 | Example Content                |
|--------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| blob   | File content                               | Source code, text files        |
| tree   | Directory structure (points to blobs/trees) | List of files, subdirectories |
| commit | Snapshot metadata + root tree reference     | Author, message, parent, tree |

### Real-World Scenario: Power of Git's Object Database
Suppose you are collaborating on a software project. You make a series of changes, commit them, and later realize a bug was introduced. With Git's object database, you can use `git bisect` to efficiently find the exact commit that introduced the bug, or use `git checkout` to revert to any previous state. The object database ensures every version is stored efficiently and can be shared or restored at any time, enabling robust collaboration and recovery workflows.

## 1. Rebasing in Git

### 1.1 What is Rebasing?
- Rebasing is the process of reapplying a series of commits on top of another base tip.
- Used to clean up, reorder, or edit commits before publishing to a shared repository.
- Especially useful for unpublished local commits.

### 1.2 Interactive Rebase (`git rebase -i`)
- Allows you to edit commit history interactively.
- Command:
  ```bash
  git rebase -i <commit-id>
  ```
  - `<commit-id>`: The commit before the first one you want to rebase.
- In the editor, you can:
  - Change the order of commits
  - Delete commits
  - Edit commits (with `edit`)
  - Drop commits
- Example edit script:
  ```text
  pick abcd123 Add logging
  pick efgh456 Fix bug
  pick xyzw789 Update Makefile
  ```
  Can be reordered or transformed into:
  ```text
  pick efgh456 Fix bug
  edit abcd123 Add logging
  drop xyzw789 Update Makefile
  ```
- To continue after resolving conflicts or editing:
  ```bash
  git rebase --continue
  ```
- If conflicts arise:
  - Fix the conflict
  - `git add` to stage resolved files
  - Continue with `git rebase --continue`
  - Use `git status` to see the current state

### 1.3 Merge Conflicts During Rebase
- Changing the order of commits may lead to merge conflicts.
- Resolve them manually, stage, and continue the rebase process.
- The original history is preserved until you finish and force-update the branch.

## 2. Remote Repositories and Distributed Git

### 2.1 Git as a Distributed VCS
- Git is fundamentally distributed: there is no required central authority.
- Multiple repositories can exist (e.g., in different locations), each with equal status.
- In practice, some repositories (like Linus Torvalds' for Linux) are treated as authoritative, but Git itself does not enforce this.
- Each repository can know about "remotes" (other repositories it can fetch from or push to).

### 2.2 Viewing and Managing Remotes
- `git remote`: List all remotes
- `git remote -v`: List remotes with fetch and push URLs
- By convention, the default remote after cloning is called `origin`.
- You can add or change remotes:
  ```bash
  git remote add <name> <url>
  git remote set-url <name> <new-url>
  ```

### 2.3 Fetch vs Pull
| Command     | Behavior                                         |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `git fetch` | Fetch changes from remote without merging         |
| `git pull`  | Fetch + Merge (potentially causing merge conflicts) |

- `git fetch` updates your repository's view of the remote branches (e.g., `origin/main`), but does not change your local branches.
- `git pull` is equivalent to `git fetch` followed by `git merge` (or `git rebase`, depending on config).
- Some developers prefer to fetch and rebase manually to avoid unnecessary merge commits.
- Tracking branches (created with `git branch --track <branch> origin/<branch>`) help keep local and remote branches in sync.

#### Example: Keeping Main in Sync
- Some developers always keep their `main` branch identical to `origin/main` and do development in feature branches, rebasing as needed.

## 3. Stashing

### 3.1 What is Stashing?
- Stashing temporarily saves work-in-progress changes when you're not ready to commit them.
- Useful if you need to switch context (e.g., fix a bug on another branch) without committing incomplete work.
- Commands:
  - `git stash push`: Save current uncommitted changes
  - `git stash apply`: Reapply the last saved stashed changes
  - `git stash list`: View stashed entries
  - `git stash show`: View contents of the top stash
  - `git stash drop`: Remove a stash entry
  - `git stash pop`: Apply and remove the top stash
- Alternative manual stashing:
  ```bash
  git diff > patch.diff
  git checkout branch
  # Later
  patch -p1 < patch.diff
  ```
- Stashing is preferred in workflows where every commit must build and pass tests.

---

## 4. Bisecting: Finding Bug Introductions

### 4.1 Git Bisect
- Used to find the commit that introduced a bug between two known good/bad states.
- Uses binary search (log₂N complexity) to minimize the number of test runs.
- Commands:
  ```bash
  git bisect start
  git bisect bad           # current or specified bad commit
  git bisect good <commit> # known good commit
  git bisect run <script>  # automates bisection
  ```
- Example:
  ```bash
  git bisect start
  git bisect bad
  git bisect good v23
  git bisect run make check
  ```
- If a commit can't be tested (e.g., doesn't build):
  ```bash
  git bisect skip <commit>
  ```
- Some projects enforce "never break the build" to make bisecting reliable.

## 5. Git Internals: The `.git/` Directory

### 5.1 Directory Structure
| Path                | Description                                                    |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `branches/`         | (Obsolete) Old branch storage; kept for backward compatibility |
| `config`            | Project-specific Git configuration                            |
| `description`       | (Obsolete) Short description of the repository                |
| `head`              | Points to the current branch or commit                        |
| `hooks/`            | Scripts triggered by Git events (e.g., `pre-commit`)          |
| `info/exclude`      | Ignore rules not under version control                        |
| `index`             | Staging area between working directory and the repository     |
| `logs/`             | History of branch/HEAD move events                            |
| `objects/`          | Storage for all Git objects (blobs, trees, commits)           |
| `refs/`             | Human-readable names (branches, tags) mapped to SHA1          |

- Many files and directories are for backward compatibility or are rarely used (e.g., `branches/`, `description`).
- `hooks/` contains sample scripts; to activate, rename and customize as needed.
- `index` is a binary file used for efficient staging.
- `info/exclude` is like `.gitignore` but not under version control.
- `logs/` records the history of branch pointers (e.g., for recovering from mistakes).

### 5.2 Object Database
- Git stores all content as objects in `.git/objects/`.
- Objects are named by their SHA1 checksum, split into a two-character directory and a 38-character filename for efficiency.
- Early versions used flat storage, but this was slow for large repos.
- Objects are compressed binary files.
- There are also packed objects (for efficiency in large repos), but these are more advanced.

#### Object Types
| Type    | Description                                           |
|---------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| blob    | File content                                          |
| tree    | Directory structure (refers to blobs/trees)           |
| commit  | Snapshot metadata + reference to root tree            |

#### Viewing and Creating Objects
- Get type:
  ```bash
  git cat-file -t <sha>
  ```
- Get content:
  ```bash
  git cat-file -p <sha>
  ```
- Create object:
  ```bash
  echo "hello" | git hash-object -w --stdin
  ```
- Example:
  ```bash
  echo "Arma virumque cano" > aeneid.txt
  git hash-object -w aeneid.txt
  ```

#### Trees
- Trees represent directories; entries contain:
  - Name (filename or subdirectory)
  - Type (`blob` or `tree`)
  - Mode (file permissions, e.g., 100644, 040000)
  - SHA1 (points to blob or subtree)
- Example:
  ```bash
  git update-index --add --cacheinfo 100644 <blob-sha> filename.txt
  git write-tree
  ```

#### Commits
- Commits link a tree and metadata about the snapshot.
- Contents:
  ```
  tree <tree-sha>
  parent <parent-commit-sha>
  author <name> <email> <timestamp>
  committer <name> <email> <timestamp>

  <commit message>
  ```
- Create manually:
  ```bash
  git commit-tree <tree-sha> -m "message"
  ```

## 6. Porcelain vs Plumbing

| Category  | Description                                     | Examples                       |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Porcelain | User-facing commands for day-to-day use         | `git add`, `git commit`, `git push` |
| Plumbing  | Low-level commands for scripting or development | `git hash-object`, `git cat-file`, `git write-tree` |

- Porcelain commands are for everyday use; plumbing commands are for scripting, debugging, or extending Git.
- Example plumbing commands:
  - `git hash-object`: Create a new object from a file or input
  - `git cat-file`: Show type or contents of an object
  - `git write-tree`: Create a tree object from the index
  - `git commit-tree`: Create a commit object from a tree

## 7. Summary

This lecture provided an in-depth exploration of advanced Git features and internals. Key topics included interactive rebasing, distributed nature of Git, remotes and synchronization, stashing, bisecting, and a tour through the internal structure and types within the `.git/` directory. It introduced Git's core concept of representing file changes as a graph of SHA1-addressed objects, and distinguished between user-facing "porcelain" commands and low-level "plumbing" commands that interact directly with Git's object database.

## Appendix: Useful Visualizations

### Distributed Git Repositories (Example Topology)

```
Repo1 <----> Repo2 <----> Repo3
   ^                      |
   |                      v
  Repo0 <-------------- Repo4
```
- Each repo can fetch/push from/to others; no single "master" required.

### .git Directory Structure (Simplified)

```
.git/
├── branches/      # (obsolete)
├── config         # repo config
├── description    # (obsolete)
├── head           # current branch pointer
├── hooks/         # event scripts
├── info/exclude   # ignore rules
├── index          # staging area
├── logs/          # branch/HEAD history
├── objects/       # all objects (blobs, trees, commits)
├── refs/          # branch/tag names
```

### Git Object Relationships

```
[commit]
   |
   v
 [tree]---->[tree]---->[blob]
   |          |          |
   v          v          v
 [blob]    [blob]     [blob]
```
- Commits point to trees (directories), which point to blobs (files) and other trees (subdirectories).
