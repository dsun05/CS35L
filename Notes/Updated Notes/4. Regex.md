# Pattern Matching, Regular Expressions, and Emacs

## 1. Globbing (Shell Pattern Matching)

Globbing is a simple, fast pattern-matching syntax used by shells (e.g., bash) for matching file names. It is related to, but simpler and more limited than, regular expressions. Globbing is used in commands like `ls`, `echo`, `rm`, and in shell control structures like `case`.

- **Globbing matches only filename components** (parts of a path between slashes). Globs never match `/`.
- **Dot files** (files starting with `.`) are not matched by `*` or `?` unless the pattern itself starts with a dot.
- If a glob pattern matches nothing, the shell usually passes the pattern unchanged to the command.

### Globbing vs Regular Expressions

| Feature         | Globbing (Shell)         | Regular Expressions (Regex)         |
|----------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Used for       | Filenames                | Text/string matching                |
| Wildcards      | `*`, `?`, `[abc]`        | `.`, `*`, `+`, `?`, `[]`, `()`      |
| Matches `/`?   | Never                    | Can match `/` (unless told not to)  |
| Syntax         | Simple                   | More powerful, complex              |
| Negation       | `[!abc]`                 | `[^abc]`                            |
| Quoting needed | To prevent expansion     | To prevent shell expansion          |

### Special Characters and Syntax

| Symbol      | Meaning                                                        |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `*`         | Matches any sequence of zero or more characters                |
| `?`         | Matches exactly one character                                  |
| `[abc]`     | Matches any one character in the set (here: 'a', 'b', or 'c')  |
| `[a-z]`     | Matches any character in the range (here: 'a' to 'z')          |
| `[!abc]`    | Matches any character NOT in the set (negation)                |

- Use `-` at the end of a bracket expression to match a literal `-`.
- To match a literal `]`, put it first in the set: `[]abc]` matches `]`, `a`, `b`, or `c`.
- To match a literal `!`, put it anywhere but first.

#### Globbing and Directory Structure
- Globs never match `/` (directory separator).
- Patterns like `*/foo*` match `foo*` in direct subdirectories only.
- To match files two levels down: `*/*/foo*`.

#### Dot Files and Globbing
- `*` and `?` do **not** match files starting with `.` unless the pattern itself starts with a dot.
- Example: `echo *` will not show `.hidden` files.
- To match hidden files: use a pattern like `.??*` (matches hidden files with at least three characters).

#### Globbing Negation
- `[!abc]*` matches files not starting with `a`, `b`, or `c`.
- `[!abc.]*` matches files not starting with `a`, `b`, `c`, or `.`.

#### Globbing Examples

| Pattern         | Description                                 | Matches                |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| `*`             | All files except hidden ones                 | `foo`, `bar.txt`       |
| `?.txt`         | One character followed by `.txt`             | `a.txt`                |
| `[abc]*`        | Files starting with `a`, `b`, or `c`         | `apple`, `cat`         |
| `[!abc]*`       | Files not starting with `a`, `b`, or `c`     | `dog`                  |
| `*.bash`        | Files ending with `.bash`                    | `script.bash`          |
| `.??*`          | Hidden files with name length ≥ 3            | `.xrc`                 |

#### Example Directory
Suppose directory contains: `foo`, `bar`, `.hidden`, `a.txt`, `a-b.txt`

| Command                | Matches                        |
|------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `echo *`               | foo, bar, a.txt, a-b.txt       |
| `echo .*`              | .hidden, .., .                 |
| `echo ?.txt`           | None (needs 1-char name)       |
| `echo [a-c]*`          | bar                            |
| `echo [!abc]*`         | Anything not starting a/b/c    |

#### Globbing and Slashes
- Patterns never match `/`.
- A trailing slash in a pattern (e.g., `foo/`) requires the match to be a directory.

#### Globbing and Quoting
- If you want to prevent the shell from expanding a glob, quote it: `'[a-z]*'`.
- Quoting is also necessary to prevent the shell from interpreting special characters in regex patterns.

#### Why "glob"?
- The original function implementing this was called `glob`.

#### Escaping Special Characters in Globs
- To match a literal `*`, `?`, or `[`, you can escape them with a backslash (e.g., `\*`, `\?`, `\[`).
- Example: `echo file\*` matches the file named `file*` (not all files starting with `file`).

#### Shell Options Affecting Globbing
- `shopt -s dotglob`: Makes `*` and `?` match dotfiles.
- `shopt -s nullglob`: Expands globs to nothing if no match (instead of passing the pattern unchanged).

## 2. Shell I/O Redirection

Shells use file descriptors for I/O:

| Descriptor | Description        |
|------------|-------------------|
| 0          | Standard Input     |
| 1          | Standard Output    |
| 2          | Standard Error     |

### Redirection Syntax

| Syntax        | Meaning                                              |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `>`           | Redirect stdout to file (overwrite)                  |
| `>>`          | Redirect stdout to file (append)                     |
| `2>&1`        | Redirect stderr to where stdout points               |
| `3< file`     | Open file on descriptor 3 for reading                |
| `3> file`     | Open file on descriptor 3 for writing                |
| `3<> file`    | Open file for reading and writing on descriptor 3    |
| `3>&1 1>file` | Save current stdout on fd 3, then redirect stdout    |

### Here Documents
A "here document" feeds a block of text as stdin to a command:

```bash
cat <<EOF
line one
line two
EOF
```
- Variable expansion occurs unless the delimiter is quoted: `<< 'EOF'` prevents expansion.

### File Descriptor Redirection Diagram
```
[stdin 0] <---+         +---> [stdout 1] ---> file or terminal
              |         |
              |         +---> [stderr 2] ---> file or terminal
              |
         [other fds: 3,4,...]
```

### Common Redirection Idioms
| Idiom                | Meaning                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `command > file`     | stdout to file (overwrite)              |
| `command >> file`    | stdout to file (append)                 |
| `command 2> file`    | stderr to file                          |
| `command > out 2>&1` | stdout and stderr to same file          |
| `command < file`     | stdin from file                         |
| `command 2>&1 >file` | stderr to old stdout, then stdout to file|

### Using Custom File Descriptors in Scripts
```bash
exec 3>log.txt   # Open log.txt for writing on fd 3
echo "log entry" >&3
exec 3>&-        # Close fd 3
```

## 3. Shell Scripting: Exit, Return, Functions, Scripts, Aliases

### Exit and Return

| Command   | Effect                                 |
|-----------|----------------------------------------|
| `exit`    | Terminates shell or script              |
| `exit 1`  | Exits with status code 1                |
| `return`  | Exits from a shell function only        |

- `exit` ends the shell; `return` only exits a function.
- Exit status of last command: `$?`

### Shell Functions vs. Shell Scripts

#### Shell Function
```bash
g() {
  grep "$@"
}
```
- Defined in `.profile` or interactively
- Lightweight, runs in current shell
- Not visible to other programs

#### Shell Script
File `g`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
grep "$@"
```
- Saved in a directory in `$PATH`
- Executed as a new process
- Visible to all programs

| Feature     | Function (in-shell) | Script (file)         |
|-------------|---------------------|-----------------------|
| Scope       | Local to shell      | Global (all programs) |
| Overhead    | Low                 | High (new process)    |
| Portability | Low                 | High                  |
| Speed       | Fast for small      | Better for large      |

#### Aliases
- For simple substitutions only:
```bash
alias g='grep'
```
- Not suitable for complex logic; use functions instead.

### Sourcing Scripts
- Use `source script.sh` or `. script.sh` to run a script in the current shell (variables/functions persist).

### Variable Scope Example
```bash
myfunc() {
  local x=5
  echo "x in function: $x"
}
x=10
myfunc
# x outside function is still 10
```

### Script/Function/Alias Execution Flowchart
```
+-------------------+
| User enters name  |
+---------+---------+
          |
          v
+-------------------+
| Is it an alias?   |--yes--> expand and run
|        |          |
|        no         v
|             Is it a function? |--yes--> run in current shell
|        |          |
|        no         v
|             Is it a script in $PATH? |--yes--> run as new process
|        |          |
|        no         v
|             Command not found
```

## 4. Regular Expressions (Regex)

Regular expressions are a "little language" for string pattern matching, used in tools like `grep`, `sed`, `awk`, Python, etc. There are multiple regex syntaxes (ERE, BRE, Perl, Python, etc.)—be careful to use the right one for your tool.

### Extended Regular Expressions (ERE)
- Use with `grep -E` or `egrep`.

#### Core Syntax and Operators

| Operator      | Description                                      |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `.`           | Any character except newline                     |
| `*`           | 0 or more repetitions                           |
| `+`           | 1 or more repetitions                           |
| `?`           | 0 or 1 occurrence (optional)                    |
| `|`           | Alternation (OR)                                |
| `()`          | Grouping (changes precedence)                   |
| `{n}`         | Exactly n occurrences                           |
| `{n,m}`       | Between n and m repetitions                     |
| `^`           | Start of line anchor                            |
| `$`           | End of line anchor                              |
| `[]`          | Bracket expressions (character classes)         |

#### Operator Precedence (Highest to Lowest)
1. `*`, `+`, `?`, `{}`
2. Concatenation
3. `|` (alternation)

#### Bracket Expressions
- `[abc]`: matches 'a', 'b', or 'c'
- `[a-z]`: matches any lowercase letter
- `[^abc]`: matches any character except 'a', 'b', or 'c'
- `[[:alpha:]]`: matches any alphabetic character (locale-aware)
- To include `-`, put it at the end: `[a-z-]`
- To include `]`, put it first: `[]abc]`
- To include `^`, put it anywhere but first
- Inside brackets, `-` denotes range unless at start or end
- Backslash is NOT special inside brackets

##### Special bracket tricks
- `[.]`, `[-]`, `[]]` — see above for how to include these literally
- `[[:alnum:]]`, `[[:digit:]]`, `[[:print:]]` — POSIX character classes

#### Examples

| Pattern            | Matches Example                        |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `abc`              | Only the string 'abc'                  |
| `a.b`              | 'a' followed by any char, then 'b'     |
| `a*`               | zero or more 'a's                      |
| `a+`               | one or more 'a's                       |
| `(ab|cd)+`         | 'ab' or 'cd', repeated                 |
| `^xyz$`            | entire line must be 'xyz'              |
| `^(.)(.)(.).\3\2\1$` | six-character palindromes             |

#### Anchors
- `^` at start: match only at beginning of line
- `$` at end: match only at end of line

#### Quoting and Escaping
- Backslash escapes special characters: `\*`, `\.`, `\(`, etc.
- To match `\`, often need `\\` (shell and regex both interpret backslash)
- Be careful: the shell may expand or interpret backslashes before passing to grep
- Always quote regex patterns in the shell to avoid globbing: `'[a-z]*'`

#### Common Pitfalls
- A regex with just a backslash (`\`) is invalid
- Quoting and escaping can be tricky—test your patterns

#### Bracket Expression Edge Cases
- To include `-` literally, put it at the start or end: `[-a-z]` or `[a-z-]`
- To include `]` literally, put it first: `[]a-z]`
- To include `^` literally, put it anywhere but first
- Ranges like `[z-a]` are invalid
- `[a-]` matches 'a' or '-'
- `[a-z-]` matches 'a' to 'z' and '-'

##### ASCII Diagram: Bracket Expression Rules
```
[ ^ ]
 |   |
 |   +-- If first after [, means negation
 +------ If not first, just a literal ^

[ - ]
 |   |
 |   +-- If at start or end, literal -
 +------ Else, range

[ ] ]
 |   |
 |   +-- If first after [, literal ]
 +------ Else, ends bracket expression
```

### Basic Regular Expressions (BRE)
- Used with `grep` (no `-E`)
- Fewer metacharacters are special: `+`, `?`, `{}` are NOT special
- Use `\(...\)` for grouping
- Use `\{n,m\}` for repetition
- No alternation (`|`) operator

#### Backreferences (BRE only)
- `\1`, `\2`, ... refer to the nth parenthesized group
- Example: `\(abc\)\1` matches 'abcabc'
- Example: `^\(\.\)\(\.\)\2\1$` matches 4-character palindromes
- Backreferences are slow and non-regular—avoid if possible

#### Example Table
| Pattern                | Description                                 |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `\(abc\)\1`           | Matches 'abcabc'                            |
| `\(^a.*b$\)`          | Entire line starting with a, ending with b  |
| `^\(.\)\(.\)\2\1$`    | Matches 4-character palindromes             |

### Regex Syntax Comparison
| Feature         | ERE (`grep -E`) | BRE (`grep`) | Perl/Python | Globbing |
|-----------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| Grouping        | `()`            | `\(\)`      | `()`        | N/A      |
| Alternation     | `|`             | N/A         | `|`         | N/A      |
| `+`, `?`, `{}`  | Yes             | No (use `\{}`) | Yes      | N/A      |
| Backrefs        | N/A             | `\1`, `\2`  | `\1`, `\g<1>` | N/A  |
| Wildcard        | `.`             | `.`         | `.`         | `*`, `?` |
| Negation        | `[^abc]`        | `[^abc]`    | `[^abc]`    | `[!abc]` |

### Regex Matching Process Diagram
```
+-------------------+
| Start at position |
+---------+---------+
          |
          v
+-------------------+
| Try to match next |
| regex element     |
+---------+---------+
          |
          v
+-------------------+
| If match, advance |
| else, backtrack   |
+---------+---------+
          |
          v
+-------------------+
| End: full match?  |
+---------+---------+
          |
      yes | no
          v
   Success  Fail
```

### Greedy vs Non-Greedy Quantifiers
- **Greedy**: Match as much as possible (default: `*`, `+`, `?`)
- **Non-greedy (lazy)**: Match as little as possible (Perl/Python: `*?`, `+?`, `??`)
- Example (Python):
```python
import re
s = 'aaaab'
print(re.match(r'a+?', s).group())  # 'a' (non-greedy)
print(re.match(r'a+', s).group())   # 'aaaa' (greedy)
```

### Multiline Matching Example (Python)
```python
import re
text = """foo\nbar\nbaz"""
print(re.findall(r'^b.*', text, re.MULTILINE))  # ['bar', 'baz']
```

### Example: Regex in Python
```python
import re
pattern = r'\b\w{3}\b'
text = 'cat dog bird fish'
print(re.findall(pattern, text))  # ['cat', 'dog']
```

## 5. Emacs: Keyboard-Driven Text Editing

Emacs is a highly extensible, keyboard-driven text editor. Its philosophy is to maximize efficiency by minimizing hand movement from the keyboard. It is modular, with major and minor modes, and features a powerful mini-buffer for commands and scripting.

### Core Concepts
- **Buffers**: In-memory views of files, outputs, or shell sessions
- **Windows**: Viewports into buffers (not OS windows)
- **Kill Ring**: Stores multiple cut/copied text entries; cycle with `M-y` after `C-y`

### Essential Commands

| Command         | Action                                    |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `C-x C-f`       | Open file                                 |
| `C-x C-s`       | Save file                                 |
| `C-g`           | Cancel current command                     |
| `C-SPC`/`C-@`   | Set mark at cursor (start selection)      |
| `M-w`           | Copy region to kill ring                  |
| `C-w`           | Cut (kill) region                         |
| `C-y`           | Yank (paste) last kill ring               |
| `M-y`           | Cycle through kill ring after yank        |
| `C-x C-x`       | Exchange point and mark                   |
| `C-x b`         | Switch buffer                             |
| `C-x C-b`       | List all buffers                          |
| `C-x o`         | Switch windows                            |
| `C-x 2`         | Split window horizontally                 |
| `C-x 3`         | Split window vertically                   |
| `C-x 0`         | Close current window                      |
| `C-x 1`         | Maximize current window                   |
| `C-h k`         | Describe key binding                      |
| `C-h m`         | Describe current mode                     |
| `C-h i`         | Info documentation browser                |

- **Meta key (`M-`)**: Usually `Alt` or `Esc`

### Mini-buffer Operations
- `M-x`: Run Emacs command by name
- `M-:`: Evaluate Emacs Lisp
- `M-!`: Run shell command
- `M-|`: Run shell command with region as input

#### Examples
- `M-! date`: Run shell `date` command
- `M-| sort`: Sort selected region

### Modes
- **Major modes**: Tailor Emacs for file type or buffer (e.g., Fundamental, Dired)
- **Minor modes**: Add auxiliary features (e.g., line numbers)
- Use `C-h m` to see active modes and key bindings

### Emacs Configuration Files
- User configuration is stored in `~/.emacs` or `~/.emacs.d/init.el`.
- You can customize Emacs by adding Emacs Lisp code to these files.

### Example: Simple Emacs Lisp Function
```elisp
(defun hello-world ()
  (interactive)
  (message "Hello, world!"))
```
- Run with `M-x hello-world`.

C-y: yank most recent
M-y: cycle through previous kills
```
