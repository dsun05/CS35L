## 1.1 What is Software Construction?
- CS 35L focuses on software construction: the practical art and science of building software that works, not just toy programs.
- Prerequisite: CS 31 (basic algorithms, data structures, C++). CS31 focused on sequential programs on a single core; this is now only a small part of modern software development.
- Modern software construction involves gluing together code, often written by others, and building on the shoulders of giants.
- The field of software construction is rapidly evolving, especially with the rise of machine learning and AI assistants.

**Comparison of Key Terms**

| Term                  | Focus/Definition                                                                 |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Programming           | Writing code to solve specific problems, often in isolation                      |
| Software Construction | Building robust, maintainable, and scalable software using best practices        |
| Software Engineering  | Systematic, disciplined approach to the design, development, and maintenance     |

## 1.2 The Changing Landscape of Software Development
- The "half-life" of CS knowledge used to be ~7 years, then stabilized at ~15 years, but is now shrinking again due to rapid advances (e.g., machine learning).
- You must expect to learn new technologies throughout your career.
- AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot, Cloud Code) can help, but are not yet reliable enough for unsupervised use (current success rate ~75%).
- You must still know how to code and verify results manually; AI is a tool, not a replacement.

**Examples of Rapidly Changing Technologies**

| Old Technology      | New Technology/Trend         |
|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| CVS, Subversion    | Git, GitHub, GitLab         |
| Make               | CMake, Bazel, npm, Gradle    |
| Perl, Shell scripts| Python, Node.js, Go          |
| Manual deployment  | Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD    |
| On-prem servers    | Cloud (AWS, GCP, Azure)      |

---

## 1.3 Course Structure and Goals
- **Group Project:** Teams of ~5 will design and build a client-server application (e.g., a groundskeeping scheduler for UCLA).
- **Individual Assignments:** Six solo assignments covering a range of technologies and skills.
- **Technologies:** Node.js and React are recommended, but not required. Other technologies include Bash, Emacs, Make, Git, Python.
- **Learning Objective:** Rapidly learn and apply new software technologies; focus on practical, hands-on skills.

## 1.4 Core Topics Overview

### 1.4.1 File Systems
- Data and programs are stored in files, organized into directories.
- Linux and the POSIX model are used as the case study.
- Key concepts: file abstractions, storage structure, permissions, metadata.

| Concept    | Definition                                      |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| File       | Named data container in a filesystem            |
| Directory  | File that lists other files                     |
| POSIX      | Portable Operating System Interface (standard)  |
| Permission | Access rights (read, write, execute)            |
| Metadata   | Data about files (owner, size, timestamps)      |

**Example: File Permissions**

| Symbol | Meaning         |
|--------|----------------|
| r      | Read           |
| w      | Write          |
| x      | Execute        |

**Sample Directory Tree**
```
/home/user/
  |-- notes.txt
  |-- code/
      |-- main.c
      |-- utils.c
  |-- docs/
      |-- manual.md
```

### 1.4.2 Scripting
- Scripting: writing programs (scripts) to automate tasks, often with interpreted or command-based languages.
- Languages: Bash (shell scripting), Emacs Lisp, Python.
- Tools: Emacs (text editor/IDE), interactive shell operations.

| Tool        | Use Case                                |
|-------------|------------------------------------------|
| Bash        | Automating build tasks, scripting tools |
| Emacs Lisp  | Writing scripts in Emacs                |
| Python      | General-purpose scripting               |

**Example: Bash Script**
```
#!/bin/bash
for file in *.txt; do
  echo "Processing $file"
done
```

**Example: Python Script**
```
import os
for filename in os.listdir('.'):
    if filename.endswith('.txt'):
        print(f"Processing {filename}")
```

| Language    | Strengths                | Weaknesses                |
|-------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| Bash        | Native to Unix, simple   | Hard for complex logic    |
| Python      | Powerful, readable       | Slower for shell tasks    |
| Emacs Lisp  | Extends Emacs            | Niche, steep learning     |

### 1.4.3 Build and Distribution
- Building: converting source into executable programs.
- Distribution: installing programs for use on other systems.
- Tools: make, npm (for JavaScript projects).
- Challenges: consistency across systems, managing dependencies.

**Build Process Flow**
```
[Source Code] -> [Build Tool: make/npm] -> [Executable/Package] -> [Distribution/Install]
```

| Build Tool | Language/Platform | Key Features           |
|------------|------------------|------------------------|
| make       | C/C++            | Dependency tracking    |
| npm        | JavaScript/Node  | Package management     |
| CMake      | C/C++            | Cross-platform builds  |
| Gradle     | Java/Kotlin      | Flexible scripting     |

### 1.4.4 Version Control
- Track and manage changes to code; support collaboration.
- Tool: Git (underlying technology for GitHub).
- Concepts: commit, branch, merge, tag.

| Concept | Explanation                                 |
|---------|---------------------------------------------|
| Commit  | Set of changes saved to the repository      |
| Branch  | Separate line of development                |
| Merge   | Combining changes from different branches   |
| Tag     | Named commit, usually for release versions  |

**Branching and Merging**
```
main
  |
  |---- feature1
  |         \
  |-----------> merge
  |
```

| Command                | Description                        |
|------------------------|------------------------------------|
| git init               | Initialize a new repo              |
| git add <file>         | Stage file for commit              |
| git commit -m "msg"    | Commit staged changes              |
| git branch <name>      | Create a new branch                |
| git checkout <name>    | Switch branches                    |
| git merge <name>       | Merge branch into current          |
| git log                | Show commit history                |

### 1.4.5 Low-Level Debugging and Dynamic Linking
- Focus: understanding compiled artifacts and their behavior.
- Tools: GDB (GNU Debugger), dynamic linkers.
- Slightly higher-level than CS33; emphasis on dynamic linking and fallback mechanisms.

**Static vs. Dynamic Linking**
```
[Program] --(static linking)--> [Executable with all code included]
[Program] --(dynamic linking)--> [Executable + Shared Libraries]
```

**Example: Dynamic Linking**
- When you run `ldd /usr/bin/less`, you see which shared libraries are loaded at runtime.

### 1.4.6 Client-Server Architecture
- Model: server holds shared state (e.g., database, schedules); clients communicate with the server, not directly with each other.
- Example: groundskeeping scheduler—server tracks all schedules, clients update/view schedules.

**Client-Server Request/Response Cycle**
```
Client ----request----> Server
         <---response---
```

**ASCII Diagram: Client-Server Model**
```
+---------+         +---------+         +---------+
| Client  |         | Server  |         | Client  |
|   A     | <-----> |  State  | <-----> |   B     |
+---------+         +---------+         +---------+
      \                                   /
       \_______________________________/
           (No direct client-to-client)
```

---

## 1.7 Mechanics and Logistics
- Course materials on BruinLearn and web.cs.ucla.edu.
- Piazza used for Q&A and participation (worth 1% of grade).
- Assignments due before 23:55 on due date; late penalty grows geometrically (1 day late = -1pt, 2 days = -3pt, 3 days = -9pt, etc.).
- Hard deadline: Friday of 10th week for all submissions.
- Grading breakdown:
  - Assignments: 18%
  - Class participation: 1%
  - Feedback surveys: 0.5%
  - Midterm: 18%
  - Final: 27%
  - Project: ~35%
- Academic integrity: work solo on assignments, do not share code, cite all sources (including AI tools and search queries used).
- Required to submit an appendix with logs of AI/search tool usage and a brief after-action report for each assignment.

---

## 1.8 Project and Assignment Details
- **Project:**
  - Group of ~5, build a client-server app (e.g., groundskeeping scheduler).
  - Must specify and understand the problem, write an informal specification, and implement using chosen technology (Node/React suggested, but not required).
  - Focus on learning new technology quickly and building a usable, demo-quality app.
  - **Best Practices:**
    - Communicate frequently with your team (use version control for all code).
    - Write clear documentation and keep your README up to date.
    - Use branches for features/bugfixes and merge regularly to avoid conflicts.
    - Test your code before merging to main.
    - Keep your project scope realistic and well-defined.
- **Assignments:**
  - Solo, spec-driven, submitted on BruinLearn.
  - Test cases provided; robust code required (no arbitrary limits like 255-byte strings).
  - Stick to provided code style in skeletons.
  - **Tips:**
    - Read the assignment spec carefully before starting.
    - Start early to allow time for debugging and resubmission.
    - Use the auto-grader feedback to improve your solution.
    - Log your use of AI/search tools as required.

---

## 1.9 Resources and Best Practices
- Written reports and oral presentations required for the project.
- Proper citation of sources is expected (use DOIs for scholarly papers).
- Review templates and rubrics for technical reports and presentations.
- Recommended reading: David Patterson's "How to Give a Bad Talk" (do the opposite!).

## 1.10 Introduction to Linux, Shell, and Emacs
- Linux servers (CSNET) run Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.5 on Intel Xeon hardware.
- The shell (bash) is a command-line interpreter (CLI) that launches programs and scripts.
- The shell is a thin layer around the OS, designed to be transparent and simple.
- Programs (executables) are static files; processes are running instances of programs.
- Multiple processes can run from the same executable file.
- The shell itself is a program (e.g., bash, tcsh, zsh).
- The shell acts as a user interface to the OS, allowing users to:
  - Start and manage processes
  - Redirect input/output
  - Chain commands together (pipes)
  - Automate tasks with scripts

**Common Shell Commands**

| Command         | Purpose                                 |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------|
| ls              | List files in a directory               |
| cd              | Change current directory                |
| pwd             | Print working directory                 |
| cp              | Copy files or directories               |
| mv              | Move/rename files or directories        |
| rm              | Remove files or directories             |
| cat             | Concatenate and display file contents   |
| grep            | Search for patterns in files            |
| chmod           | Change file permissions                 |
| ps              | Show running processes                  |
| kill            | Terminate a process                     |

- Process tree: systemd/init → shell (bash) → user commands (e.g., less, emacs).

**ASCII Diagram: Process Tree**
```
[systemd/init]
     |
   [bash]
     |
  [less] or [emacs]
```

**Relationship: Applications, Libraries, System Calls, Kernel, Hardware**
```
[Application]
     |
     v
[Library: libc, etc.]
     |
     v
[System Calls]
     |
     v
[Kernel]
     |
     v
[Hardware]
```

**Example: File Read in C**
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    FILE *f = fopen("file.txt", "r"); // library call (libc)
    char buf[100];
    fread(buf, 1, 100, f);             // library call (libc)
    fclose(f);
    return 0;
}
```
- The `fopen`, `fread`, and `fclose` functions are library calls. Under the hood, they use system calls like `open`, `read`, and `close` to interact with the kernel.

**Tracing Program Behavior**
- `strace <command>`: Shows all system calls made by a program (e.g., file access, process creation).
- `ltrace <command>`: Shows library calls (e.g., `printf`, `malloc`).

| Tool     | What it Traces         | Example Use Case                |
|----------|------------------------|---------------------------------|
| strace   | System calls           | Debug file/network access       |
| ltrace   | Library calls          | Debug C library usage           |

- Emacs: powerful, extensible text editor (originally "editor macros").
- Emacs commands: ordinary characters insert text; control/meta characters invoke commands.
- Control characters: ASCII 0-31 (e.g., Ctrl-A = 1, Ctrl-X Ctrl-C = exit Emacs).
- Meta key: sets the top bit of the character (e.g., Meta-X for command mode).
- Emacs help: Ctrl-H for help, Ctrl-H K for help on a key sequence.
- ASCII character set: 0-127, divided into four 32-character regions (printable, control, etc.).
- Null byte (0) is a valid ASCII character (Ctrl-@).

**ASCII Table Regions**

| Range   | Description           |
|---------|----------------------|
| 0-31    | Control characters   |
| 32-63   | Printable (punct.)   |
| 64-95   | Printable (letters)  |
| 96-127  | Printable/special    |

### Example Commands

| Command                                 | Action                        |
|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| ssh username@lnxsrv11.cs.ucla.edu       | Log into CSNet                |
| uname -r                                | Show kernel version           |
| cat /proc/cpuinfo                       | View CPU info                 |
| lsb_release -a                          | Show system info              |
| ldd /usr/bin/less                       | List libraries used by 'less' |

---

## 1.11 Course Philosophy and Advice
- Focus on learning by doing; avoid inefficient learning (e.g., banging your head against the wall).
- Use office hours, discussion, and peer support.
- Assignments are designed to be challenging but fair; auto-grader allows resubmission.
- Don't cheat yourself by copying code—learn the material for your own benefit.
- If you use AI or search tools, log your prompts/queries and results, and reflect on their usefulness.
- **Practical Tips:**
  - When learning a new tool, always figure out how to exit it first (e.g., `Ctrl-X Ctrl-C` for Emacs, `:q` for Vim).
  - Keep a personal log of errors and solutions for future reference.
  - Practice using the shell and Emacs regularly to build muscle memory.
  - When stuck, break the problem into smaller parts and test incrementally.
  - Ask for help early—don't wait until the last minute.

---

## 1.12 First Steps in Linux and Shell
- Logging into CSNET, using SSH.
- Basic shell commands (e.g., `cat /proc/cpuinfo`, `ldd /usr/bin/less`).
- Understanding the relationship between hardware, kernel, libraries, and applications.
- System calls: special function calls that drop into the kernel (e.g., open, read, write, close). These are the only way user programs interact with the kernel and, by extension, the hardware.
- Libraries: C library (libc), C++ standard library, crypto libraries, etc. Libraries provide reusable code and often wrap system calls with higher-level abstractions.
- Applications use libraries, which in turn use system calls.
- Executable files vs. running processes.

**Relationship: Applications, Libraries, System Calls, Kernel, Hardware**

    char buf[100];
    fread(buf, 1, 100, f);             // library call (libc)
    fclose(f);
    return 0;

## 1.13 Emacs and ASCII Details
- Emacs: text editor, also used for scripting (Emacs Lisp).
- ASCII: 7-bit character set (0-127), printable and control characters.
- Control characters: generated by clearing the second bit (e.g., Ctrl-A = 1).
- Meta key: sets the top bit (not standard ASCII, but used in Emacs).
- Emacs help system: Ctrl-H for help, Ctrl-H K for key sequence help.
- Exiting Emacs: Ctrl-X Ctrl-C or `M-x save-buffers-kill-terminal`.

**More Emacs Shortcuts**

| Key Sequence      | Operation                                 |

## 1.14 Next Steps
- Next lecture: deeper dive into file systems and shell scripting.
- Continue learning by hands-on practice in Linux and Emacs.

---

## 1.15 Instructor Anecdotes, Warnings, and Subtle Points

- **AI Verification Anecdote:**
  - The instructor shared a story about using Gemini (an AI assistant) to answer a Python question for an exam. The AI gave a plausible but incorrect answer, which was only revealed by running the code. This underscores the importance of always verifying AI-generated code and not trusting it blindly.
  - AI tools can be helpful, but their answers may look correct while being wrong. Always test and verify.

- **AI and Job Security:**
  - Current AI assistants are not reliable enough to automate yourself out of a job. Their error rate is too high for production use. You must know how to do things by hand and critically evaluate AI output.

- **Programs vs. Processes:**
  - A program (executable) is a static file; a process is a running instance of a program. Multiple processes can run from the same executable. This distinction is fundamental in Linux/Unix systems.

- **Learning to Exit Programs:**
  - The most important thing to learn about any new program is how to exit it. For Emacs, this is `Ctrl-X Ctrl-C`. This is a practical tip for all new tools and environments.

- **Course Philosophy:**
  - The course is designed to be fun and practical, focusing on building real, usable software and learning by doing. Students are encouraged to ask questions, use resources, and avoid inefficient solo struggles.
