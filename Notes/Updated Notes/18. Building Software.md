# Lecture 18: Building Software, Build Automation, and Databases

## 1. The Painstaking Process of Building Software

- Building and delivering software is a painstaking, error-prone process.
- Historically, all steps were done by hand: writing code, compiling, linking, running.
- In early CS courses (CS31/32), students manage these steps manually.
- **Theme:** Whenever a task is boring or repetitive, automate it! If you don't, someone else will.

---

## 2. Automating the Build Process

### 2.1 Naive Automation with Scripts
- Developers write shell or Python scripts to automate builds.
- Example shell script:
  ```sh
  #!/bin/sh
  gcc -c foo1.c
  gcc -c foo2.c
  gcc -c foo3.c
  echo $1 > foo4.c
  gcc -c foo4.c
  gcc foo1.o foo2.o foo3.o foo4.o -o myprogram
  ```
- **Problems:**
  - Inefficient: recompiles everything, even if only one file changed.
  - Not scalable for large projects.
  - No partial builds; always does full rebuild.

### 2.2 The Need for Smarter Automation
- Ideal: Only rebuild what's necessary (incremental builds).
- Desire for a tool that can "partially execute" a build script, skipping unnecessary steps.

#### Example: Incremental Build with `make`
Suppose you change only `foo2.c`:

1. `make` checks timestamps:
   - `foo2.c` is newer than `foo2.o` → rebuild `foo2.o`.
   - `foo1.o`, `foo3.o`, `foo4.o` are up-to-date → not rebuilt.
   - `myprogram` is now older than `foo2.o` → relink all `.o` files.
2. Only the necessary steps are performed, saving time.

**Step-by-step:**
```
$ touch foo2.c           # Simulate editing foo2.c
$ make
  gcc -c foo2.c         # Only foo2.o is rebuilt
  gcc foo1.o foo2.o foo3.o foo4.o -o myprogram  # Relink
```

---

## 3. `make`: Smarter Build Automation

### 3.1 What is `make`?
- A tool that automates builds, only rebuilding what's needed.
- Input: a `Makefile` describing targets, dependencies, and build commands.
- Uses file timestamps to determine what needs rebuilding.

### 3.2 Makefile Structure
- Rules:
  ```makefile
  target: dependencies
  	command-to-build-target
  ```
- Example:
  ```makefile
  myprogram: foo1.o foo2.o foo3.o foo4.o
  	gcc foo1.o foo2.o foo3.o foo4.o -o myprogram

  foo1.o: foo1.c
  	gcc -c foo1.c

  foo2.o: foo2.c bar.h
  	gcc -c foo2.c

  foo3.o: foo3.c
  	gcc -c foo3.c

  foo4.c:
  	echo $1 > foo4.c

  foo4.o: foo4.c
  	gcc -c foo4.c
  ```

### 3.3 How `make` Works
- Compares timestamps: if a target is older than any dependency, it rebuilds.
- Skips steps if target is up-to-date.
- **Dependency Graph:** Internally, `make` builds a graph of targets and dependencies.
- Can detect cycles (e.g., A depends on B, B on A) and will error out.

#### Example: Make Dependency Graph (ASCII Diagram)

```
   foo1.c   foo2.c   foo3.c   foo4.c
      |        |        |        |
      v        v        v        v
   foo1.o   foo2.o   foo3.o   foo4.o
      \       |        /        /
        \     |      /        /
           v  v  v  v
           myprogram
```

### 3.4 Common Pitfalls
- **Forgetting dependencies:** If a file includes a header (e.g., `bar.h`) but the Makefile omits it, changes to the header won't trigger rebuilds.
- **Over-specifying dependencies:** Adds unnecessary rebuilds but ensures correctness.
- **Solution:** Use compilers (GCC/Clang) to auto-generate dependencies (e.g., `-MMD` flag).

#### Example: Missing Dependency
```makefile
foo2.o: foo2.c
	gcc -c foo2.c
```
If `foo2.c` includes `bar.h` and `bar.h` changes, `foo2.o` will NOT be rebuilt! Fix:
```makefile
foo2.o: foo2.c bar.h
	gcc -c foo2.c
```

#### Example: Dependency Cycle (Error)
```
A: B
B: A
```
This creates a cycle. `make` will report an error:
```
make: Circular A <- B dependency dropped.
```

#### Table: Makefile Pitfalls and Solutions
| Pitfall                | Consequence                  | Solution                        |
|------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Missing dependency     | Outdated builds, bugs        | List all headers as dependencies |
| Over-specifying        | Unnecessary rebuilds         | Use auto-generated dependencies  |
| Cyclic dependencies    | Build fails                  | Refactor dependency graph        |

### 3.5 Clock Skew
- Distributed builds can suffer from inconsistent clocks (clock skew).
- Can cause unnecessary or missed builds.
- **Alternative:** Use file checksums instead of timestamps (more management overhead).

### 3.6 Parallel Builds
- `make -j` runs independent build steps in parallel.
- Great for large projects and multi-core machines (e.g., Linux kernel builds).

### 3.7 Scaling Build Systems
- **Recursive make:** Each subdirectory has its own Makefile; top-level Makefile runs `cd subdir && make`.
  - Harder to parallelize.
- **Single top-level Makefile with includes:**
  - Centralized control, better parallelism.
  - Uses `include` directives to pull in sub-makefiles.

### 3.8 Modern Build Systems
- **CMake:** Generates platform-specific Makefiles or Ninja files; supports complex projects and cross-platform builds.
- **Ninja:** Fast, minimal build system; often used as a backend for CMake.
- **Bazel:** Scalable, hermetic builds; used by Google and others for large codebases.
- **Meson:** Modern, fast, user-friendly; generates Ninja files.

| Tool   | Strengths                        | Typical Use Case           |
|--------|----------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Make   | Simple, ubiquitous               | Small/medium C/C++ projects|
| CMake  | Cross-platform, feature-rich     | Large, portable projects   |
| Ninja  | Extremely fast, simple syntax    | Backend for CMake/Meson    |
| Bazel  | Scalable, reproducible, language-agnostic | Monorepos, CI/CD |
| Meson  | Modern, easy to use, fast        | Modern C/C++/Python builds |

## 4. Portability and System Configuration

### 4.1 The Problem
- Not all platforms support the same system calls (e.g., `renameat2()` on Linux, not Windows).

### 4.2 Conditional Compilation
- Use C preprocessor to select implementations:
  ```c
  #ifdef __linux__
      // Use renameat2
  #else
      // Use fallback logic
  #endif
  ```
- **Problem:** OS-based checks can break if OSes add/remove features.

### 4.3 Feature Testing (Preferred)
- Instead of checking OS, check if the feature exists.
- Write a test program to probe for the feature during build.
- Generate a config header (e.g., `config.h`):
  ```c
  #define HAS_RENAMEAT2 1
  ```

### 4.4 Build-Time Configuration Tools

| Tool        | Purpose                                                      |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `configure` | Probes system, generates `config.h`                          |
| `autoconf`  | Generates the `configure` script                             |
| `automake`  | Generates portable `Makefile`s                               |

- These tools automate and layer the build configuration process.

#### ASCII Diagram: Autotools Configuration Flow
```
[autoconf] ---> [configure script]
      |                |
      v                v
[configure.ac]     [User runs ./configure]
                        |
                        v
                [config.h, Makefile]
```

## 5. Packaging in Higher-Level Languages

### 5.1 Python Example
- Uses `pyproject.toml` for metadata and build configuration.
  ```toml
  [build-system]
  requires = ["setuptools >= 77.0"]
  build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"

  [project]
  name = "myproject"
  version = "1.0.0"
  authors = [{ name = "Your Name", email = "you@example.com" }]
  license = "GPL-3.0"
  ```
- **Warning:** Faulty configuration files can break installs and compatibility.

#### Table: Python Packaging Tools
| Tool         | Purpose                        |
|--------------|-------------------------------|
| pip          | Install Python packages        |
| setuptools   | Build and distribute packages  |
| wheel        | Binary package format          |
| virtualenv   | Isolated Python environments  |
| pyproject.toml | Modern build/config metadata |

#### Example: setup.py
```python
from setuptools import setup
setup(
    name='myproject',
    version='1.0.0',
    author='Your Name',
    packages=['myproject'],
    install_requires=[],
)
```

## 6. Databases: Why Not Just Use File Systems?

### 6.1 Motivation
- File systems are unstructured, lack consistency guarantees, and are slow for search.
- Databases provide:
  - Structured access
  - Consistency
  - Efficient search
  - Concurrency-safe access

### 6.2 Relational Databases
- **Data Model:** Tables (relations) with rows and columns.
- **Columns:** Typed (e.g., `INT`, `VARCHAR(255)`).
- **Rows:** Each is a record/entity. Usually unique (set semantics), but some DBs allow duplicates (multiset).
- **Keys:**
  - **Primary key:** Uniquely identifies a row (e.g., student ID).
  - **Foreign key:** References a key in another table; enforces referential integrity.
- **NULL:** Some DBs allow missing values (NULL), leading to three-valued logic (TRUE, FALSE, UNKNOWN).

### 6.3 Relational Algebra
- **Selection:**
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM student WHERE major = 'CS';
  -- Returns only rows where major is CS
  ```
- **Projection:**
  ```sql
  SELECT DISTINCT major FROM student;
  -- Returns unique majors only
  ```
- **Join:**
  ```sql
  SELECT student.id, student.major, class.class
  FROM student JOIN class ON student.id = class.student_id;
  ```

#### Expanded Examples
- **Selection:**
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM student WHERE major = 'CS';
  -- Returns only rows where major is CS
  ```
- **Projection:**
  ```sql
  SELECT DISTINCT major FROM student;
  -- Returns unique majors only
  ```
- **Join:**
  ```sql
  SELECT student.id, student.major, class.class
  FROM student JOIN class ON student.id = class.student_id;
  ```

| Operation   | SQL Example                                      | Result Description                |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Selection   | SELECT * FROM student WHERE major = 'CS';         | Filters rows by predicate         |
| Projection  | SELECT DISTINCT major FROM student;               | Selects columns, removes dups     |
| Join        | SELECT ... FROM A JOIN B ON A.x = B.y;            | Combines rows on matching columns |
| Union       | SELECT ... FROM A UNION SELECT ... FROM B;         | Combines rows from both tables    |
| Intersection| SELECT ... FROM A INTERSECT SELECT ... FROM B;     | Rows common to both tables        |
| Cartesian   | SELECT * FROM A, B;                               | All combinations of rows          |

### 6.4 SQL: Structured Query Language
- **Schema definition:**
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE student (
      id INT PRIMARY KEY,
      family_name VARCHAR(255),
      given_names VARCHAR(255),
      major VARCHAR(64)
  );

  CREATE TABLE class (
      student_id INT,
      letter_grade VARCHAR(2),
      FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES student(id)
  );
  ```
- **Insert:**
  ```sql
  INSERT INTO student VALUES (1, 'Abdul-Jabbar', 'Kareem', 'Sociology');
  INSERT INTO student VALUES (2, 'Coppola', 'Francis', 'Film Studies');
  ```
- **Query:**
  ```sql
  SELECT id, major FROM student ORDER BY major ASC;
  ```

## 7. Alternative Database Models

### 7.1 Entity-Relationship (ER) Model
- Focuses on entities (objects), attributes (properties), and relationships (references).
- Can be implemented atop relational DBs or from scratch.

### 7.2 Object-Oriented Databases
- Data as objects with attributes, methods, and class hierarchies.
- Integrates code (methods) with data.

### 7.3 NoSQL
- Rejects rigid table format; allows flexible, dynamic schemas.
- **Key-value stores:** Like hash tables, but persistent.
- **Wide-column:** Columns can differ between rows.
- **Document stores:** Store arbitrary documents (JSON, XML, etc.).
- **Graph databases:** Entities as nodes, relationships as edges; supports cycles and arbitrary graphs.
- **Trade-off:** More flexibility, but may lack strong guarantees and efficient search.

#### Table: NoSQL Database Types
| Type         | Example Systems      | Data Model         | Strengths                | Weaknesses                |
|--------------|---------------------|--------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| Key-Value    | Redis, DynamoDB     | Hash table         | Fast, simple             | No structure, limited query|
| Wide-Column  | Cassandra, HBase    | Table, flexible    | Scalable, flexible       | Complex, eventual consistency|
| Document     | MongoDB, CouchDB    | JSON/BSON/XML      | Flexible, nested data    | Weaker consistency, joins hard|
| Graph        | Neo4j, ArangoDB     | Nodes/edges        | Rich relationships       | Niche, complex queries    |

#### Example: Document Store (MongoDB)
```json
{
  "_id": 1,
  "name": "Alice",
  "courses": ["CS101", "CS102"]
}
```

## 8. Database Reliability: ACID Properties

| Property     | Description                                                      |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Atomicity    | Transactions are all-or-nothing                                  |
| Consistency  | DB always satisfies constraints/invariants                       |
| Isolation    | Concurrent operations don't interfere (as if run sequentially)   |
| Durability   | Changes persist across failures                                  |

- **Example:**
  ```sql
  BEGIN TRANSACTION;
  INSERT INTO student VALUES (...);
  UPDATE classes SET grade='A' WHERE ...;
  COMMIT;
  ```
- Without atomicity, partial changes may persist if system crashes.
- Without isolation, concurrent users may see inconsistent data.

#### Example: Transaction Failure (Atomicity Violation)
Suppose a bank transfer:
```
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE id = 1;
-- System crashes here!
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE id = 2;
COMMIT;
```
If atomicity is not enforced, $100 is lost! With atomicity, neither change is visible after crash.

#### ASCII Diagram: Transaction Timeline
```
[Start Transaction]
      |
      v
[Step 1: Deduct $100 from A]
      |
      v
[System Crash]
      |
      v
[Recovery: Rollback]
      |
      v
[No changes applied]
```

#### Example: Isolation Violation
If two users transfer from the same account at the same time, without isolation, both may see the same initial balance and overdraw the account. With isolation, transactions appear to run one after another.

### 8.1 Compromising ACID
- Some cloud/NoSQL DBs sacrifice consistency or isolation for scalability (eventual consistency).
- Developers must balance speed, complexity, and correctness.

### 8.2 Practical Tools
- **Firebase:** Popular NoSQL backend; not fully ACID-compliant, emphasizes client sync.
- **Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL:** Relational, support full ACID.
