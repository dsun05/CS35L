# Lecture 10: Version Control and Backups

## 1. Introduction: Why Version Control?
- **Version control** is about more than just tracking code changes; it's fundamentally about managing history and enabling recovery from mistakes or failures.
- **Backups** are a general concept: you want to know not only what you have today, but what you had yesterday, last week, last year, etc.
- **Version control** can be seen as a specialized backup system for source code, but backups are needed for many things beyond code.
- **Analogy:** Backups are like a time machine for your entire house; version control is a time machine for your work desk, letting you see every change you made to your projects.

## 2. Backups vs. Version Control: Roles and Responsibilities
- **Traditional division:**
  - *Developers*: Innovate, create new things, push the envelope.
  - *Operations staff*: Maintain stability, ensure nothing is lost, manage backups.
- **DevOps approach:**
  - Blurs the line between development and operations; everyone is responsible for both innovation and maintenance.
  - DevOps teams manage their own backups and deployments, streamlining processes.
- **Key Difference:**
  - Backups focus on disaster recovery and data retention.
  - Version control focuses on tracking changes, collaboration, and project history.

### Summary Table: Backup vs. Version Control
| Aspect                | Backup System                        | Version Control System           |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Primary Purpose       | Disaster recovery, data retention    | Track changes, enable collaboration |
| Granularity           | Whole files, directories, or disks   | Individual changes (commits)     |
| History Depth         | Snapshots at intervals               | Complete, fine-grained history   |
| Collaboration         | Not designed for collaboration       | Built-in support (branches, merges) |
| Recovery Model        | Restore to previous state            | Revert/checkout any commit       |
| Metadata Tracked      | File metadata, timestamps            | Author, message, diffs, metadata |
| Typical Use Cases     | System restore, accidental deletion  | Software development, document editing |

### Real-World Scenario: Backup vs. Version Control
Suppose you are working on a research paper. If you accidentally delete the file, a backup system allows you to restore the last saved version. However, if you want to see how your paper evolved, compare different drafts, or collaborate with co-authors, a version control system like Git is essential. Version control lets you track every change, revert to any previous version, and merge contributions from multiple people.

## 3. Why Do We Need Backups? (Failure Models)
- **Purpose:** To recover from failures (hardware, user error, attacks, bugs, insider threats).
- **Failure model:**
  - You must know what kinds of failures you want to protect against to design a good backup strategy.
  - Without a clear failure model, you risk wasting resources or missing critical risks.

### Common Failure Types and Examples
| Type             | Description                                                                 | Example                                  |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Hardware         | Drive fails (flash or disk); e.g., 1–2% annualized failure rate (AFR) for flash, ~2–4% for disks. | Disk crash, SSD wear-out                 |
| User Error       | Accidental deletion or overwriting of files.                                | `rm -rf *` in wrong directory            |
| Attacker Action  | External or internal attackers delete or modify data.                       | Ransomware, disgruntled employee         |
| Software Bug     | Bugs that corrupt or delete data.                                           | Faulty update script wipes configs       |
| Insider Threat   | Trusted users (e.g., with shared accounts) tamper with data.                | Admin deletes logs to hide activity      |

- **AFR (Annualized Failure Rate):**
  - E.g., 1–2% for flash drives in server environments; higher for disks.
  - Large installations (Amazon, Google) see these rates in practice.
  - **Correlated failures:**
    - Multiple drives from the same batch may fail together (manufacturing defect).
    - Power surges, firmware bugs, or environmental hazards can cause simultaneous failures.

## 4. Simple Backup Models: Mirroring
- **Mirroring:** Keep two identical copies of all data.
  - *Pros:* Simple, protects against single drive failure.
  - *Cons:* Doubles storage cost, assumes independent failures (not always true—bad batches, shared environments).
- **AFR for Mirroring:**
  - Naive: Square the AFR (e.g., 0.01 × 0.01 = 0.0001) for both drives failing in a year (if independent).
  - Realistic: Must consider correlated failures and recovery time (e.g., time to replace a failed drive).
  - Actual risk is lower if failed drives are replaced promptly, but higher if failures are correlated.
  - **Revised AFR Calculation (Considering Recovery Time):**
    - If a drive fails and is replaced within a certain time window (e.g., 10 hours), the probability of data loss is the probability that the second drive fails during that window.
    - The revised formula is:
      - `AFR ≈ AFR_single * (AFR_single * (drive replacement time / 1 year))`
      - For example, if AFR_single = 0.01 (1%), and replacement time is 10 hours:
        - `AFR ≈ 0.01 * (0.01 * (10 / (365*24)))`
    - This is much lower than simply squaring the AFR, provided prompt replacement and independent failures.

  **Mirroring and Recovery Window (Detailed ASCII Diagram):**
  ```
  Time 0:         Drive 1 fails
                  |
                  v
  +---------------+-------------------+-------------------+
  | Both drives OK| Only Drive 2 OK   | Both drives failed|
  +---------------+-------------------+-------------------+
                  |<-- Replacement -->|
                  |   Window (e.g. 10h) 
  +---------------+-------------------+-------------------+
  | Data safe     | Data at risk      | Data lost         |
  +---------------+-------------------+-------------------+
  ```
  *Data is only at risk if the second drive fails during the replacement window after the first failure. If both drives are in the same enclosure and a power surge occurs, both may fail at once—mirroring does not protect against this.*

## 5. Recovery Models: Testing Your Backups
- **Don't just model failure—model recovery!**
  - Many engineers forget to test recovery.
  - Example: Simulate a drive failure by unplugging a device and see if you can recover.
  - *Personal test:* Lose your laptop for a weekend—can you still get your work done?

  > **Philosophy:**
  > "Don't just think it, do it." Test your recovery model in practice, not just in theory.

  **Common Mistakes Table:**
  | Mistake                        | Consequence                                 |
  |--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
  | Only model failure, not recovery| Backups may be useless in a real emergency  |
  | Forget to test restore process | Can't recover when needed                   |
  | Assume backups work            | False sense of security                     |
  | Delete incrementals blindly    | Lose ability to restore full history        |

  **Backup Testing Checklist:**
  - [ ] Can you restore a single file?
  - [ ] Can you restore an entire directory?
  - [ ] Can you restore to a new machine?
  - [ ] Are all permissions, links, and metadata preserved?
  - [ ] Are encrypted files still accessible?

## 6. What to Back Up?
- **Data to back up:**
  - File contents
  - File names
  - Directory structure
  - Permissions, ownership, access rights (as shown by `ls -l`)
  - Timestamps (modification time)
  - Inode/link count (for hard links)
  - Symbolic link contents and file types
  - Backup meta-information (version number, timestamp, creator)
- **Delicate files:**
  - Passwords, encryption keys—handle with care! Don't store in backups unless secured; many breaches have resulted from mishandling these.
- **Be thorough:**
  - If `ls -l` or `ls -li` shows it, you probably need to back it up.
  - Easy to forget things like hard links or symlink contents—be meticulous.

  **File System Metadata Table:**
  | Metadata         | Why It Matters                        |
  |------------------|---------------------------------------|
  | Permissions      | Security, access control              |
  | Ownership        | Determines file access                |
  | Timestamps       | Auditing, synchronization             |
  | Hard links       | Prevents data loss, preserves structure|
  | Symlinks         | Maintains references, avoids breakage |
  | File types       | Correct restoration                   |

## 7. Backup Strategies: Periodic, Incremental, and Rotational
- **Full backup:** Snapshot of the entire system at a point in time.
- **Incremental backup:** Only changed files since the last backup.
  - *Pros:* Saves space and time.
  - *Cons:* Restoring requires all incrementals to be intact; more fragile.
- **Rotational/Consolidation:**
  - Keep frequent (e.g., hourly) backups for recent data, less frequent (e.g., daily/weekly) for older data.
  - Combine adjacent incrementals to save space.
  - *Caution:* Don't delete incrementals blindly—combine them to avoid losing the ability to restore.

  **Backup Rotation/Retention Flow:**
  ```
  +-------------------+
  |  Recent Backups   |
  | (hourly, daily)   |
  +-------------------+
            |
            v
  +-------------------+
  |  Older Backups    |
  | (weekly, monthly) |
  +-------------------+
            |
            v
  +-------------------+
  |   Oldest Backups  |
  | (archived, tape)  |
  +-------------------+
  ```
  *As time passes, frequent backups are consolidated or deleted, retaining only less frequent snapshots for older data.*

  **Scenario:**
  - You have hourly backups for the last 24 hours, daily for the last month, and monthly for the last year. If you need a file from 6 months ago, you restore from the monthly backup.

## 8. Efficient Backup Techniques
- **Differencing (diff/patch):**
  - Store only the changes (diffs) between file versions, not the whole file.
  - Example:
    ```bash
    diff -u old_file new_file > changes.diff
    patch old_file < changes.diff
    ```
  - *Pros:* Saves space, especially for large files with small changes.
  - *Cons:* All diffs must be intact to restore; more fragile.
- **Data grooming:**
  - Don't back up files you can easily recreate (e.g., `.o` files, build artifacts).
  - Use scripts to exclude such files before backup.
  - *Note:* Data grooming often requires user input or customization to avoid missing important files.
- **Deduplication:**
  - Avoid storing identical data blocks multiple times.
  - Block-level deduplication: Only unique blocks are stored; identical blocks are referenced by pointers.
  - *Copy-on-write (COW):* New blocks are only created when data is changed.
  - *Caveat:* If a shared block is lost, all referencing files are affected. Not a substitute for true redundancy—always maintain physically separate copies for critical data.
- **Compression:**
  - Use lossless compression (e.g., gzip) to reduce backup size.
  - *Tradeoff:* Slower backup/restore, but often negligible with modern CPUs.
- **Encryption:**
  - Encrypt backups to protect against unauthorized access (especially if stored offsite or in the cloud).
- **Staging (multi-tier backups):**
  - Use multiple backup layers: e.g., flash → disk → tape.
  - Tape is slowest/cheapest, disk is mid-tier, flash is fastest/most expensive.
- **Multiplexing:**
  - Use a single backup device for multiple data sources to save on hardware costs.
- **Checksums:**
  - Compute and store checksums (e.g., SHA256) for backup data.
  - Later, verify backups by comparing checksums—cheap and effective for integrity checking.
- **Format conversion:**
  - Use lossless compression (e.g., gzip) to reduce backup size.
  - *Note:* Format conversion (e.g., CRLF vs. LF) is often a pain, but Git can handle it automatically for you, saving you from manual headaches.

  **Technique Comparison Table:**
  | Technique      | Space Savings | Speed Impact | Risk/Tradeoff                        |
  |---------------|--------------|--------------|--------------------------------------|
  | Deduplication | High         | Low          | Shared block loss affects many files  |
  | Compression   | Medium       | Low/Medium   | Slower restore, but usually minor     |
  | Encryption    | None         | Low/Medium   | Key management is critical            |

## 9. Caching and Backup Reliability
- **Cache vs. backup:**
  - Caches are small/fast, backups are big/slow.
  - Don't rely on caches as backups; treat them as primary data, not backup copies.
- **Incremental/diff risk:**
  - If any incremental or diff is lost/corrupted, you may lose the ability to restore.
  - Reliability of storage is critical for incremental/diff-based backups.

  **Scenario:**
  - Your browser cache lets you quickly reload a page, but if your hard drive fails, the cache is lost. Only a backup can restore your data.

## 10. From Backups to Version Control: Developer Needs
- **Backups alone are not enough for software development.**
- **Version control systems (VCS) provide:**
  - Efficient lookups of old versions (must be fast, not just possible).
  - File rename tracking: Recognize when a file is renamed, not just deleted/created.
  - Metadata about development history (e.g., tags, commit messages, authorship).
  - Atomic commits: Group multiple changes into a single, all-or-nothing operation. Prevents inconsistent intermediate states.
  - Hooks: Custom scripts (pre-commit, post-commit, etc.) to enforce policies or automate tasks.
  - Format conversion: Handle line ending differences (e.g., CRLF vs. LF) between platforms.
  - Signed commits: Cryptographically verify authorship and integrity of changes.

  **Backup vs. Version Control Table:**
  | Feature                | Backup System | Version Control System |
  |------------------------|:-------------:|:---------------------:|
  | Fast lookup of history |      No       |         Yes           |
  | Track renames/moves    |      No       |         Yes           |
  | Metadata (commits, etc)|      No       |         Yes           |
  | Atomic changes         |      No       |         Yes           |
  | Collaboration tools    |      No       |         Yes           |
  | Signed/authenticated   |      No       |         Yes           |

## 11. Git: The Most Popular Version Control System
- **Two key concepts in Git:**
  1. **Object database:**
     - Stores the complete history of your project as a database of objects (blobs, trees, commits, tags).
     - Persistent, shared with other developers.
  2. **Index (cache):**
     - Stores your planned changes (the "staging area").
     - Private to you, not shared until committed.
     - Allows you to prepare and review changes before committing to history.
- **Workflow:**
  - You can spend time perfecting your index (staging area), then commit to the object database for a clean, understandable history.
  - Clean histories are easier for collaborators to review and accept.
- **Git clone:**
  - Copies the object database, creates a trivial index, and sets up working files.
  - Local clones are fast and use hard links for deduplication.

  **Git Data Flow (Detailed):**
  ```
  +----------------+      git add      +-------------+      git commit      +-------------------+
  | Working Files  | --------------->  |   Index     |  ----------------->  |  Object Database  |
  | (your edits)   |                   | (Staging)   |                      | (History)         |
  +----------------+                   +-------------+                      +-------------------+
         |                                   |                                      |
         |  git checkout                     |  git reset                           |
         +-----------------------------------+--------------------------------------+
  ```
  *You edit files, stage changes in the index, and commit them to the object database (history). You can also reset or checkout to move between these states.*

## 12. Real-World Example: CSNet Snapshots
- **Snapshot directories:**
  - Many systems (e.g., CSNet) provide snapshot directories with hourly, daily, and weekly backups.
  - Implemented using block-level deduplication and snapshotting.
  - Users can recover files from up to two weeks ago, with all metadata preserved.

  **Scenario:**
  - You accidentally delete a file. You navigate to the snapshot directory, find yesterday's version, and restore it with all permissions and links intact.

## 13. Summary: Best Practices
- Always have a clear failure and recovery model.
- Test your backups—don't just assume they work.
- Be thorough in what you back up (metadata, links, permissions, etc.).
- Use efficient, cost-effective strategies (incrementals, deduplication, compression, encryption, checksums).
- For software development, use a version control system that supports atomic commits, metadata, hooks, and efficient history access.
- Understand the distinction between backups and version control, and use both appropriately.

**Best Practices Checklist:**
- [ ] Have a documented failure model
- [ ] Regularly test recovery
- [ ] Back up all necessary metadata
- [ ] Use efficient backup strategies
- [ ] Use version control for code and documents
- [ ] Secure sensitive data in backups
- [ ] Periodically review and update backup/versioning procedures
