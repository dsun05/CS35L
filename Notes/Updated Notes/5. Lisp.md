# Scripting Languages — Syntax, Semantics, Pragmatics, and Emacs Lisp

## 1. Introduction to Scripting Languages

When discussing programming languages, three major areas are essential:

| Category     | Description                                               | Scripting Example | Traditional Example |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Syntax       | Structure or form of code (e.g., semicolons, braces).     | Python: whitespace, Shell: no braces | C++: braces, semicolons |
| Semantics    | Meaning or behavior of the program—what the code does.    | Python: dynamic typing, Shell: command execution | C++: static typing, compiled execution |
| Pragmatics   | Practical concerns: efficiency, configuration, usability, security, and interoperability. Most emphasized in scripting. | Python: glue code, Shell: automation | C++: performance, static analysis |

- Scripting languages focus heavily on pragmatics, not just syntax or semantics.
- Pragmatics includes: how to get things working, configuration, efficiency, security, trust, and integration with other modules.

**Pragmatics in Action:**
> Suppose you need to automate a nightly backup. In C++, you would need to write, compile, and deploy a program, handling all errors and edge cases. In Bash, a 3-line script using `rsync` and a cron job suffices. The scripting approach wins on pragmatics: speed, integration, and ease of change.

## 2. Overview of Example Scripting Languages

| Language     | Primary Use                | Integration         | Performance | Extensibility | Example Code |
|--------------|----------------------------|---------------------|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| Shell        | OS automation, scripting   | Unix tools, files   | Low         | High         | `echo Hello` |
| Emacs Lisp   | Editor extension           | Emacs internals     | Low-Medium  | Very High    | `(message "Hi")` |
| Python       | General scripting, glue    | C/C++ modules, APIs | Medium      | High         | `print("Hi")` |
| JavaScript   | Web, extension, general    | Browsers, Node.js   | Medium-High | High         | `console.log("Hi")` |

**Bytecode and JIT:**
- **Bytecode:** An intermediate, platform-independent code executed by a virtual machine (e.g., Python `.pyc`, Java `.class`).
- **JIT (Just-In-Time) Compilation:** Converts bytecode to native machine code at runtime for speed (e.g., JavaScript V8, Java HotSpot).

## 3. Key Themes of Scripting Languages

### Ease of Use
- Scripting languages prioritize accessibility and quick onboarding.
- Easy to learn, fast to write short scripts (e.g., "Hello World!").
- Low barrier to entry increases ecosystem participation.

### Reliability
- Scripting languages avoid worst-case crashes common in C++ (e.g., null pointer exceptions, subscript errors).
- Instead, they raise exceptions or print errors.
- **Downside:** Permissiveness may allow incorrect programs to execute, decreasing logical reliability.

| Language   | Crashes on Subscript Error? | Throws Exception? |
|------------|-----------------------------|--------------------|
| C++        | Yes                         | No                 |
| Python     | No                          | Yes                |
| Shell      | No                          | Typically alerts   |

**Example:**
- C++:
  ```cpp
  int arr[2] = {1,2};
  int x = arr[5]; // Undefined behavior, may crash
  ```
- Python:
  ```python
  arr = [1,2]
  x = arr[5] # Raises IndexError
  ```

### Scalability
- Good for small to medium programs, glue code, and lightweight data transformation.
- Problems with very large codebases due to lack of strict typing and fragmented tooling.
- Large systems often use scripting languages to configure or glue together performant code written in C++ or similar.

### Performance
- Generally slower than compiled languages due to runtime checks and interpreted execution.
- Tradeoff: slower performance for higher productivity and reliability.
- JIT compilers and bytecode interpreters (e.g., JavaScript, Emacs Lisp) help mitigate the performance gap.
- Example: C++ is fast because it doesn't do subscript checking; Python checks at runtime and throws exceptions.

**Productivity vs. Performance:**
```

## 4. Concepts and Philosophical Differences

### General vs. Extension Languages

| Language Type     | Example           | Description                                                                          | Example Code |
|------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| General Purpose   | Python, Java      | Use it for almost anything                                                          | `print(42)`  |
| Extension         | JavaScript, ELisp | Embedded in host applications (e.g., browser, editor) to extend functionality       | `(message "Hi")` or `alert('Hi')` |

**Extension Language Example:**
- JavaScript in a browser:
  ```javascript
  document.body.style.background = 'yellow';
  ```
- Emacs Lisp in Emacs:
  ```elisp
  (set-background-color "yellow")
  ```

### Traditional vs. Scripting

| Feature         | Scripting Languages           | Traditional Languages       |
|------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Performance      | Low                          | High                        |
| Flexibility      | High                         | Medium                      |
| Error Handling   | Graceful                     | Harsh (e.g. segfaults)      |
| Compilation      | Optional or runtime only     | Mandatory                   |
| Type System      | Dynamic/optional             | Static/mandatory            |
| Tooling          | Fragmented, lightweight      | Mature, integrated          |
| Deployment       | Script file, interpreter     | Compiled binary             |

### Design Purpose of Languages

| Language        | Intended Use                                        |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| JavaScript      | Extending browser functionality                   |
| Shell           | Automated OS-level task and config scripts         |

## 5. Emacs Lisp: An Introduction

### Historical Context and Purpose
- Lisp was created for AI in the 1960s, focusing on self-modifying and program-generating code.
- Emacs Lisp is a variant tailored to the GNU Emacs text editor.
- Emacs Lisp is an **extension language**: enhances and customizes Emacs behavior.

### Emacs Lisp as an Extension Language
- Deep integration with Emacs internals: buffers, windows, syntax highlighting, etc.
- Provides primitives focused on editing rather than general computing (compare to SAP's payroll-specific extension language).
- Emacs is built on:
  - Low-Level C libraries
  - Lisp Interpreter written in C

**Emacs Architecture:**
```
+-------------------+
|   Emacs (C Core)  |
+-------------------+
         |
         v
+-------------------+
| Lisp Interpreter  |
+-------------------+
         |
         v
+-------------------+
| User Lisp Code    |
+-------------------+
```

- Code entered in Emacs is interpreted or compiled into bytecode.

**Self-Modifying Code Example:**
```elisp
(defun add-x (n)
  (defun x () n))
(add-x 42)
(x) ; => 42
```

---

## 6. Syntax and Semantics in Lisp

### Lisp Syntax Characteristics
- Simple, uniform syntax using parenthesized prefix notation.
- All function calls look like: `(function arg1 arg2 ...)`
- No operator precedence, no infix notation.
- Symbols and data use homogenous parenthetical syntax.

### Structuring Code as Lists
- Code and data are blurred: both written as lists.
- Example:
  - Data: `'('a b c)`
  - Code: `(+ 34 25)`

### Symbols and Special Forms
- **Symbols**: Unique named atomic values (e.g., `nil`, `t`, `my-var`).
- **Special Forms**: Control structures and definition constructs that are not function calls (e.g., `defun`, `let`, `lambda`, `quote`).

| Special Form | Purpose                        | Example |
|--------------|--------------------------------|---------|
| defun        | Define a function              | `(defun foo (x) x)` |
| let          | Local variable binding         | `(let ((x 1)) x)`   |
| lambda       | Anonymous function             | `(lambda (x) (+ x 1))` |
| quote        | Prevent evaluation             | `'(a b c)`          |
| if           | Conditional                    | `(if cond a b)`     |
| progn        | Sequence of expressions        | `(progn a b c)`     |

### Macro Example
```elisp
(defmacro when (cond &rest body)
  `(if ,cond (progn ,@body)))

(when (> 3 2)
  (message "3 is greater than 2"))
```

### Expressions vs. Data
- `'expression` prevents evaluation.
- `(eval expression)` forces evaluation even of quoted data.

| Form              | Meaning                                |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------|
| 'abc              | Symbol `abc` as data                  |
| abc               | Evaluate variable `abc`               |
| '(a b c)          | List of three symbols a, b, c          |
| (quote (a b c))   | Same as above                          |

### Interactive Evaluation (Scratch Buffer)
- Evaluated using:
  - `C-J`: Evaluate previous expression and show result below.
  - `C-x C-e`: Evaluate expression at point and show in mini-buffer.

### Debugging Basics
- Emacs will drop into the debugger upon errors.
- Key command to exit debugger: `C-]` (Control + closing square bracket)
- Debugger sessions can nest; exit each with `C-]` until you return to the top level.

---

## 7. Emacs Lisp Data Structures

### Numbers
- Integers: Arbitrary precision (bignums)
- Floats: IEEE 64-bit doubles
- Example: `(+ 100000000000000000 1)`
- Integer division truncates; floating-point division if one operand is a float.
- No support for smaller-width floats (e.g., 8-bit) as in some ML applications.

### Strings
- Written with double quotes
- Supports newlines: `"Hello\nWorld"`
- Strings can contain any characters, including newlines.
- Functions like `format` allow C-style string formatting.

### Symbols
- Named values that point to variables or functions
- Used for identifiers, constants, or stand-alone atoms
- Special symbols:
  - `nil`: false, end of list
  - `t`: true
- Each symbol is unique by name; two symbols with the same name are the same object.

### Lists
- Fundamental concept in Lisp: "List Processing"
- Built from pairs (cons cells): each has a value and a pointer to the next cell.
- Built-in functions for lists:
  - `cons`: Construct a new pair
  - `car`: Return first element
  - `cdr`: Return rest of list

#### List Example
```elisp
(cons 'a (cons 'b nil)) ; => (a b)
```

#### Improper Lists
- If the last element is not `nil`, it's an improper list.
```elisp
(cons 'a 'b) ; => (a . b)
```
- `(a . b)` is the printed form for an improper list.

**Improper List Diagram:**
```
+-------+-------+
|  a    |   o---|---> b
+-------+-------+
```

#### Quoting and Data/Code Duality
- `'abc` yields the symbol `abc` as data.
- `'('a b c)` yields the list `(a b c)` as data.
- `(eval ...)` can turn data into code.

#### Every Paren Counts
- In Lisp, every parenthesis is meaningful. Extra parentheses change the meaning (e.g., `(n)` is a function call to `n`, not just the value of `n`).

### Vectors
- Fixed-size, indexable arrays
- Created via: `(make-vector 5 'x)`
- Less commonly used than lists, but allow random access.

### Hash Tables, Character Tables, Markers, Buffers, Frames, Windows, Processes
- **Hash Tables**: Key-value associative maps.
- **Character Tables**: Hash tables with character keys for efficiency.
- **Markers**: Pointers to specific positions in buffers that adapt as buffer changes.
- **Buffers**: Editable text containers (contents of a file, scratch, etc.).
- **Frames/Windows**: Emacs GUI elements.
- **Processes**: Represent running subprocesses (e.g., shells) under Emacs.
- **Fonts, X widgets, Terminals**: Other Emacs object types.

#### Example: Creating and Using a Marker
```elisp
(setq m (make-marker))
```
- `m` is now a marker object. To make it point to a buffer, pass a buffer argument.

#### Example: Buffers
```elisp
(current-buffer) ; returns the current buffer object
```

**Comparison Table: Lists, Vectors, Hash Tables**
| Structure   | Ordered? | Random Access | Typical Use                | Example Creation         |
|-------------|----------|---------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|
| List        | Yes      | No            | Sequence, stack, queue    | `(list 1 2 3)`          |
| Vector      | Yes      | Yes           | Fixed-size, fast lookup   | `(make-vector 3 'x)`    |
| Hash Table  | No       | Yes (by key)  | Key-value mapping         | `(make-hash-table)`     |

---

## 8. Functional Programming Concepts in Emacs Lisp

### Functions
- First-class objects
- Created via `lambda` or `defun`

#### Using `defun`:
```elisp
(defun add-three (x) (+ x 3))
```

#### Interactive Commands:
- Use `interactive` keyword to make a function callable via UI/keystrokes.
```elisp
(defun greet-user ()
  (interactive)
  (message "Hello!"))
```

#### Example:
```elisp
(defun show-buffer-name ()
  (interactive)
  (message (buffer-name)))
```

### Local Bindings (`let`)
- Creates local variables bound to evaluated values.
```elisp
(let ((x 3) (y 4)) (+ x y)) ; => 7
```
- Temporarily masks global variables if names overlap.
- `let` can bind multiple variables; each binding is a pair `(name value)`.
- If only a symbol is given, it is bound to `nil`.

**let vs. Global Variable Table:**
| Feature         | let (local)         | Global Variable         |
|-----------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Scope           | Expression/block    | Everywhere             |
| Lifetime        | Temporary           | Until unset            |
| Side Effects    | None (isolated)     | Can affect all code    |
| Example         | `(let ((x 1)) x)`   | `(setq x 1)`           |

### Lambda Expressions and Closures
- Emacs supports anonymous functions with `lambda`.
```elisp
(lambda (x y) (+ x (* y y)))
```
- Can pass lambdas as arguments or assign to variables.
- **Closures:** Functions that capture their lexical environment.
```elisp
(let ((n 10))
  (lambda (x) (+ x n))) ; Returns a function that adds 10
```

### Special Forms
- Not all parenthesized expressions are function calls. Some are special forms (e.g., `lambda`, `let`, `quote`, `defun`).
- Special forms have unique evaluation rules.

---

## 9. Emacs Lisp Utilities and Commands

### Emacs Commands
- Functions callable via UI must be declared interactive:
```elisp
(defun my-command ()
  (interactive)
  (message "Hello"))
```
- Can query keystrokes or input with `interactive` argument.

### Accessing Documentation
- `C-h k`: Describe key bindings.
- `C-h f`: Describe function.
- `C-h m`: Describe current mode.
- Mouse over source file link (e.g., window.el) to open implementation in Emacs.

**Useful Emacs Lisp Introspection Commands:**
| Command         | Description                                 |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `describe-function` | Show documentation for a function      |
| `describe-variable` | Show documentation for a variable      |
| `apropos`           | Search for functions/variables by name |
| `find-function`     | Jump to function source code           |
| `eldoc-mode`        | Show function signatures in minibuffer |

## 10. Summary

This lecture introduced scripting languages, emphasizing their focus on pragmatics—real-world concerns of integration, performance trade-offs, ease of use, reliability, and extensibility. It differentiated scripting languages from general-purpose and low-level languages, exemplified by Emacs Lisp and Python. The lecture gave an in-depth presentation of Emacs Lisp as an extension language, explaining its evaluation model, key data types (including symbols, lists, strings, functions), and its support for self-modifying code, which allows it to script and modify Emacs in powerful ways. The class also demonstrated fundamental Lisp programming techniques including quoting, evaluation, function definition, lambda expressions, local variable bindings, and debugging tools within Emacs.
