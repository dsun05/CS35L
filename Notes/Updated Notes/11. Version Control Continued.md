# Lecture 11: Version Control Continued

## 1. Introduction

This lecture continues the exploration of Git as a case study in version control, focusing on the workflow, commit lifecycle, file states, and practical commands. Emphasis is placed on understanding the relationship between the working directory, the index (staging area), and the object database (history), as well as the importance of commit messages, commit IDs, and repository configuration.

---

## 2. Git's Three States: Working Directory, Index, and Object Database

- **Working Directory (Working Files):**
  - The files you actively edit. These are visible to compilers, test programs, and other tools.
  - Changes here are not yet tracked by Git until staged.

- **Index (Cache/Staging Area/Planned Future):**
  - Where you stage files for the next commit using `git add`.
  - Represents your "planned future"—what you intend to commit next.
  - You can stage multiple changes before committing.

- **Object Database (History):**
  - Contains all committed snapshots (commits) of your project.
  - Commits are immutable; you cannot change history, only add new commits.

---

## 3. Comparing File States with `git diff`

| Command                | Compares                                 | Description                                                      |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `git diff`             | Working directory vs. staged (index)     | Shows changes not yet staged                                     |
| `git diff --cached`    | Staged (index) vs. last commit (HEAD)    | Shows what is staged but not yet committed                       |
| `git diff HEAD`        | Working directory vs. last commit        | Shows all changes since last commit                              |
| `git diff <commit>`    | Working directory vs. specific commit    | Compare with any previous commit                                 |

- `HEAD` is a symbolic name for the most recent commit.
- Use `git log` to view commit history and obtain commit hashes.

---

## 4. Staging and Committing Changes

- **Staging:**
  - `git add <filename>` stages a file for the next commit.
  - You can stage multiple files before committing.

- **Committing:**
  - `git commit` opens an editor for a commit message.
  - The commit message should explain *why* the change was made, not just *what* changed.
  - Good commit messages are crucial for future understanding and collaboration.
  - Some projects enforce commit message formats using hooks (e.g., Diffutils).

- **Hooks and Commit Rejection:**
  - Projects may use hooks to enforce commit message standards.
  - If your message doesn't match, the commit may be rejected.

---

## 5. Commit IDs and SHA-1 Checksums

- **Commit IDs:**
  - Each commit is identified by a SHA-1 hash (160 bits, 40 hex characters).
  - The hash is computed from the commit's contents and metadata (author, date, message, parent commit(s)).
  - Changing any part of a commit results in a new hash.

- **Immutability:**
  - Commits are immutable; you cannot change a commit in place.
  - If you change a commit, a new commit with a new hash is created.

- **Collision Probability:**
  - The chance of two different commits having the same SHA-1 hash is astronomically low.

- **Why Not Sequential IDs?**
  - Sequential IDs require a central server and are problematic for distributed systems.
  - SHA-1 allows decentralized, parallel development without conflicts.

---

## 6. Amending Commits

- **`git commit --amend`:**
  - Allows you to replace the most recent commit with a new one (e.g., to fix mistakes or update the message).
  - The amended commit gets a new SHA-1 hash.
  - Use with caution; beginners are encouraged to let history accumulate naturally.

---

## 7. Convenience Features and Shortcuts

- **Committing All Changes:**
  - `git commit -a -m "message"` stages and commits all tracked, modified files with a single command.
  - Not recommended for beginners; be explicit about what you stage.

- **Viewing Tracked Files:**
  - `git ls-files` lists all files tracked by Git in the current commit.

- **Searching Content:**
  - `git grep <pattern>` searches for a pattern in all tracked files.
  - Equivalent to `git ls-files | xargs grep <pattern>` but more efficient.

---

## 8. `git status` and Untracked Files

- `git status` shows:
  - Modified files
  - Staged files
  - Untracked files (not in Git or `.gitignore`)

- **Untracked Files:**
  - Git uses heuristics and `.gitignore` to decide which files to show as untracked.

---

## 9. Ignoring Files with `.gitignore`

- **Purpose:**
  - `.gitignore` lists patterns for files Git should ignore (e.g., build artifacts, temporary files).

- **Pattern Examples:**

| Pattern         | Meaning                                         |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `*.o`           | Ignore all object files in any directory         |
| `/main.mk`      | Ignore only at repository root                  |
| `build/`        | Ignore the entire `build` directory             |
| `/gnu-lib-test/`| Ignore the `gnu-lib-test` directory at root     |

- **Multiple `.gitignore` Files:**
  - You can have `.gitignore` in any directory; Git checks the closest one first.

- **Versioning:**
  - `.gitignore` is usually versioned and shared with collaborators.

---

## 10. Git Repository Configuration

- **`.git/config`:**
  - Stores repository-specific settings (core options, remotes, branches, submodules).
  - Not under version control.

- **Viewing and Editing:**
  - `git config -l` lists all configuration settings.
  - `git config <key> <value>` sets a configuration value.
  - You can edit `.git/config` directly, but back it up first.

---

## 11. Commit Reference Syntax and Arithmetic

- **Shorthand Notation:**

| Syntax         | Meaning                                              |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `HEAD`         | Latest commit on current branch                      |
| `HEAD^`        | First parent (one commit back)                       |
| `HEAD^^`       | Two commits back                                     |
| `HEAD~3`       | Three commits back                                   |
| `commit^2`     | Second parent (for merge commits)                    |
| `HEAD^!`       | Difference between current commit and its parent     |

- **Tags:**
  - Tags can be used as human-readable names for commits.
  - Use `--` to separate commit references from file names to avoid ambiguity.

---

## 12. `git blame`

- **Purpose:**
  - Shows the last commit that modified each line of a file, along with author and date.

- **Usage:**
  - `git blame <filename>`

- **Cautions:**
  - Not always reliable for finding the true origin of a bug (may only show formatting changes).
  - Should not be used to assign blame in a punitive sense; can create a toxic environment.
  - Use to trace history, not to punish.

- **Tracing Bugs:**
  1. Use `git blame` to find the commit that last changed a line.
  2. Use `git diff <commit>^!` to see what that commit changed.

```

---

## 15. Best Practices and Warnings

- Write meaningful commit messages explaining *why* changes were made.
- Don't obsess over perfect history; it's okay to make mistakes and fix them in later commits.
- Use `.gitignore` to avoid tracking unnecessary files.
- Be careful when editing `.git/config` directly.
- Use `git blame` for understanding history, not for assigning fault.
- Prefer explicit staging (`git add`) over `git commit -a` for clarity.

---

## 16. Branching

A **branch** is a lightweight, movable pointer to a commit. Branches help isolate development work and enable parallel feature development, bug fixes, and experimentation.

### 16.1 Common Use Cases

| Type                | Purpose                                                        |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Maintenance         | Stable bugfix-only version                                     |
| Feature             | Work on specific new features                                  |
| Experimental/Fork   | Alternative implementations or separate project directions     |

### 16.2 Managing Branches

```bash
git branch                # list branches
git branch newbranch      # create a new branch
git checkout newbranch    # switch to a branch
git checkout -b newbranch commit  # create and switch
git branch -d name        # delete a branch (warns if commit is unmerged)
git branch -D name        # force delete
git branch -m old new     # rename branch
```

### 16.3 Visual Representation

```
            A---B---C (master)
                     \
                      D---E---F (feature)
```
- `master` and `feature` point to different commits.
- Use `git checkout` to switch between them.
- Commits form a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), where arrows point backwards to parent commits.

---

## 17. Merging

Merging combines content from two different branches into a single commit.

```bash
git merge branchname
```

### 17.1 Merge Commit
- When merging master with another branch, Git auto-generates a new commit containing both histories.
- If there's no conflict:
  - Git auto-merges changes.
  - Creates a new commit with lineage from both parents.

### 17.2 Merge Conflicts
- Occur when the same lines are changed in both branches.
- Git inserts markers like:

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
old version
=======
new version from other branch
>>>>>>> branchname
```
- You must manually resolve conflicts and commit the result.

### 17.3 Merge Algorithms
- Git identifies the "closest common ancestor" (e.g., commit A).
- Computes changes from A to B (`diff B A`) and A to C (`diff C A`).
- If non-overlapping, Git applies changes cleanly.
- Overlapping changes cause a conflict requiring manual intervention.

---

## 18. Rebasing

Rebasing re-applies commits from one branch to another base commit.

```bash
git rebase branchname
```

- Instead of creating a merge commit, rebasing rewrites history to make it appear as if your changes were applied on top of the target branch.

### 18.1 Visual Comparison

**Merge:**
```
    A---B---C---M (merged)
         \     /
          D---E
```
**Rebase:**
```
    A---B---C---D'---E' (rebased)
         \
          D---E
```
- Rebase creates new commits (`D'`, `E'`) with same changes, but different parent.
- Resulting history is "clean", linear.

### 18.2 When to Use
- Clean, linear history after local development before pushing.
- Avoid publish-rebase: rewriting shared history causes complications.

---

## 19. Best Practices

- **Commit Messages:**
  - Describe reasoning, not just the change.
  - Avoid generic messages like "xyz."
- **Avoid Perfectionism:**
  - Don't rely heavily on `--amend` early on.
  - Mistakes are natural and traceable; history should reflect development flow.
- **Merging vs. Rebasing:**
  - Merging preserves actual development paths.
  - Rebasing simplifies history—useful for polishing before sharing.

## 20. Summary

This lecture discussed fundamental Git operations including committing, viewing differences, staging changes, and inspecting history. It elaborated on the three data states in Git (working directory, index/staging area, object database), how differences can be viewed with various `git diff` variations, and how Git uses SHA-1 for commit hashes. It introduced commit metadata importance, branch management (creation, switching, deleting, merging), and explained merging mechanics including conflict resolution. The lecture also explained rebasing as an alternate to merges and emphasized clean history and collaboration conventions. Additional commands such as `git status`, `git blame`, `git grep`, and `git ls-files` were explained for practical usage.
