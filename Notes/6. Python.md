## 1. Introduction to Python

### Motivations and Audience Challenges
- The instructor aims to address both experienced and novice Python users.
- Balances depth and foundational concepts.

### Running Python Interactively
- Python code is demonstrated using a REPL (Read–Eval–Print Loop).
- Emphasis on readability and live coding demonstrations.

### A Motivating Example: Parsing a Stock Quote
Given a string from web scraping:
```python
line = "GOOG,100,153.36"
```
Objective: Convert it into:
- Symbol: str
- Number of shares: int
- Price: float

Steps:
```python
types = [str, int, float]
s_line = line.split(",")
values = [c(v) for c, v in zip(types, s_line)]
```

Takeaways:
- Introduction to the use of `zip()`
- Introduction to list comprehensions
- Emphasis on idiomatic Python vs. C-style iteration

## 2. Python Data Types

### Basic Data Types
- Python has dynamic typing and built-in type inference.
- Primary data types discussed: str, int, float, complex

### Numbers

#### Integers
- Arbitrary precision (unlike fixed-width C/C++ integers)

Example:
```python
x = 99999999999999
x * x * x  # Large result
```

#### Floats
- Approximate numerical values using IEEE-754 representation
```python
1e309  # Returns: inf
```

#### Integer Division
```python
1 / 3     # => 0.3333... (float)
1 // 3    # => 0 (int division)
```

#### Complex Numbers
```python
1 + 2j           # Complex number
cmath.sqrt(-1)   # => 1j
```

### Strings

#### Literals
Both single and double quotes allowed:
```python
'abc' == "abc"  # True
```

#### Escape Sequences
```python
"abc\n"  # Contains a newline
r"abc\n"  # Raw string: backslash-n retained
```

#### Triple Quotes
Multiline strings:
```python
'''line1
line2'''
```

### None Type
- Python’s equivalent of null.
```python
x = None
```

---

## 3. Python Object Model

Objects in Python have:
1. Identity (via id())
2. Type (via type())
3. Value (represented through the variable binding)

### Identity
```python
x = 13
id(x)  # Memory address or unique object id
```

### Type
```python
type(x)  # => <class 'int'>
type(type(x))  # => <class 'type'>
```

### Value
- Immutable for built-in types like integers, strings
- Mutable for types like lists

### Mutability
- Immutable: int, float, str, tuple
- Mutable: list, dict, set, etc.

Example:
```python
x = [1, 2, 3]
x[0] = 9  # Mutated
```

### Variable Binding vs. Object Mutation
Example:
```python
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a
a.append(4)
# both a and b are [1,2,3,4] - same object
```

---

## 4. Programming Style: Pythonic vs. C++-ish

### Indentation
- Python uses indentation in place of curly braces `{}`.
- Use consistent spacing (e.g., 4 spaces). Avoid tabs.

Syntax for blocks:

```python
if x > 0:
    print("Positive")
else:
    print("Non-positive")
```

### Issues with Indentation
- Copy-paste can mess up indentation.
- Different systems treat tab width differently.
- Recommendation: use spaces, not tabs.

## 5. Python Sequences

### Types of Sequences
- str (immutable)
- list (mutable)
- Other sequences: tuple, range

### Indexing and Slicing

#### Indexing
```python
s = "hello"
s[0]     # 'h'
s[-1]    # 'o' (last element)
```

#### Slicing
```python
s[1:4]     # 'ell'
s[:3]      # 'hel'
s[2:]      # 'llo'
s[:]       # 'hello' (copy)
```

#### Edge Cases
- Out-of-range slicing: doesn't raise an exception.
- Index beyond end returns empty sequence.

---

## 6. Mutable Sequences

### Lists

#### List Creation
```python
x = list("abcd")       # ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
x = [1, 2, 3]
```

#### Mutation
```python
x[0] = 42
del x[1]            # Remove element at index 1
x[1:3] = [50, 60]   # Slice assignment
```

When slicing:
- `x[i:j]` returns a shallow copy
- Assignment: `x[i:j] = [a, b]`

## 7. List Operations

| Operation | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| x.append(v) | Add item `v` at end |
| x.extend(vs) | Append a list of elements |
| x.insert(i, v) | Insert `v` before position `i` |
| x.pop(i) | Remove and return element at `i` (default: last) |
| x.remove(v) | Remove first value `v` |
| x.index(v) | Return index of value `v` (throws ValueError if not found) |
| x.count(v) | Return number of occurrences of `v` |
| x.sort() | In-place sort |
| x.reverse() | Reverse list in-place |
| del x[i:j] | Delete a slice |

#### Notes
- Methods like append(), extend(), insert() mutate in-place.
- Lists are heterogenous — elements may be of different types.

## 8. List Performance: Amortized Analysis of append()

When appending to a list:

- Lists grow exponentially in size to keep append efficient:
  - Capacity doubles when full
- Average runtime per append ≈ O(1)
- Worst-case append time is O(n), but amortized O(1)

Example:
```python
lst = []
for i in range(1000):
    lst.append(i)
```

Total time = O(n), not O(n²)

## 9. Python's History and Philosophy

### Historical Context
- Draws inspiration from BASIC and ABC
- Created as a more usable, teaching-friendly language

### ABC Language Influence
- Simplicity
- Enforced indentation
- Built-in data structures (lists, maps)
- Emphasis on readability
- Designed for personal computers (floppies, optical disks)

### Why Python Succeeded
- Designed for productivity, correctness, and simplicity
- Balanced features and simplicity
- Gained traction over decades
- Practical: used from education to machine learning

---

## 10. Final Notes on Python Style

- Python encourages readable, high-level code.
- Avoid writing Python like C++ (e.g., index-based for-loops).
- Prefer idiomatic constructs such as list comprehensions and generators.

Example:
Instead of:
```python
for i in range(len(lst)):
    process(lst[i])
```

Do:
```python
for item in lst:
    process(item)
```

# Summary

This lecture introduces Python with an emphasis on both foundational concepts and Pythonic idioms that distinguish it from languages like C++. It begins with an example using stock data to illustrate Python's built-in types and functions, such as strings, integers, floats, and how to transform data efficiently using functions like zip and list comprehensions. The lecture explores key Python concepts including object identity, type, and mutability, while highlighting Python’s design philosophy that prioritizes readability, simplicity, and ease of use for both education and production. The historical evolution of Python is traced from FORTRAN, BASIC, and ABC to its role as a general-purpose language informed by pedagogical goals and scripting needs. Additional discussion covers Python's use of indentation instead of braces, the differences between mutable and immutable types, and a thorough examination of list operations, including their performance characteristics and efficiency strategies like amortized allocation. The session emphasizes Pythonic thinking, encouraging students to adopt practices that align with Python’s expressive and high-level approach to programming.
