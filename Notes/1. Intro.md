# 1. Course Introduction and Scope

## 1.1 Software Construction vs Software Engineering

- CS 35L is about software construction.
- Prerequisite: CS 31 (basic algorithms, data structures, C++).
- CS31 covered basic, sequential code on single computer cores, which is now only one small part of modern software development.
  
## 1.2 Rapid Evolution in Software Development

- Previously, knowledge "half-life" in CS was ~15 years.
- Now decreasing due to rapid advances like machine learning.
- Students will constantly have to learn new software construction techniques throughout careers.

## 1.3 Generative AI and Software Construction

- Instructor is not a machine learning expert but emphasizes its growing influence.
- Tools like ChatGPT, Copilot, Cloud Code can help but cannot be fully relied upon.
- AI assistants' current ~75% accuracy is not good enough for production code.
- Students must still know how to code and verify results manually.

# 2. Course Structure

## 2.1 Projects and Assignments

- Group Project (5 people per team) - Practical software construction experience.
- Individual Assignments (6 total) - Cover various technologies and programming skills.

## 2.2 Technologies Used

- Recommended: Node.js, React (JavaScript-based stack).
- Additional topics/tools: Bash, Emacs, Make, Git, Python.

## 2.3 Tools and Learning Objectives

- Learn to rapidly adopt and use new software technologies.
- Build competence in pragmatic programming rather than theoretical deep-dives.

|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| File             | A named data container in a filesystem           |
| Directory        | A file that lists other files                    |
| POSIX            | Portable Operating System Interface (standard)   |

## 3.2 Scripting

### Definition:
Writing programs (scripts) used to automate tasks, often with interpreted or command-based languages.

### Languages Covered:
- Bash (shell scripting)
- Emacs Lisp
- Python

### Tools:
- Emacs: open-source text editor and development environment.
- Interactive shell operations.

### Examples:

|-------------|------------------------------------------|
| Bash        | Automating build tasks, scripting tools |
| Emacs Lisp  | Writing scripts in Emacs                |
| Python      | General-purpose scripting               |

## 3.3 Build and Distribution

### Concepts:
- Building: Converting source into executable programs.
- Distribution: Installing programs for use on other systems.

### Tools:
- make
- npm (for JavaScript projects)

### Challenges:
- Consistency across systems.
- Managing dependencies.

## 3.4 Version Control

### Key Ideas:
- Track and manage changes to code.
- Support collaboration.

### Tool Used:
- Git

- Server holds shared state (e.g., database, schedules).
- Clients communicate with the server but not with each other.
- Communication is indirect and goes through a server.

### Example Application:
UCLA Groundskeeping Scheduler

| Component | Role                                         |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------|

# 10. Summary

This lecture sets the groundwork for CS 35L, a course focused on modern software construction practices beyond simple algorithm design. It frames software development in practical terms, emphasizing real-world technologies, version control, scripting, debugging, system interaction, and manageable project design using client-server architecture. It also explores how generative AI tools are beginning to change the development workflow—though caution is advised when using them. Key infrastructure such as the Linux command line, Emacs, and common Unix tools will be explored in depth. The course structure balances individual exercises with a collaborative capstone project, providing both technical experience and exposure to core skills in pragmatic software engineering.
