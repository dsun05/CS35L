First, I searched the git log for any mention of "merge result tree object" using the command: git log --grep='merge result tree object' and got the output:

These two commits are administrative (merge branching), but clearly reference two other commits related to this issue with their commit titles. I searched for these commits with: 

1. git log --grep='merge-ort: return early when failing to write a blob'
2. git log --grep='merge-ort: fix segmentation fault in read-only repositories'

After running the first command, I noticed that the output had 3 seperate commits, the two administrative commits I found before, and then the original commit. Here is the output for the original commit which includes the commit id, code changes, and author:

    merge-ort: return early when failing to write a blob
    
    In the previous commit, we fixed a segmentation fault when a tree object
    could not be written.
    
    However, before the tree object is written, `merge-ort` wants to write
    out a blob object (except in cases where the merge results in a blob
    that already exists in the database). And this can fail, too, but we
    ignore that write failure so far.
    
    Let's pay close attention and error out early if the blob could not be
    written. This reduces the error output of t4301.25 ("merge-ort fails
    gracefully in a read-only repository") from:
    
            error: insufficient permission for adding an object to repository database ./objects
            error: error: Unable to add numbers to database
            error: insufficient permission for adding an object to repository database ./objects
            error: error: Unable to add greeting to database
            error: insufficient permission for adding an object to repository database ./objects
            fatal: failure to merge
    
    to:
    
            error: insufficient permission for adding an object to repository database ./objects
            error: error: Unable to add numbers to database
            fatal: failure to merge
    
    This is _not_ just a cosmetic change: Even though one might assume that
    the operation would have failed anyway at the point when the new tree
    object is written (and the corresponding tree object _will_ be new if it
    contains a blob that is new), but that is not so: As pointed out by
    Elijah Newren, when Git has previously been allowed to add loose objects
    via `sudo` calls, it is very possible that the blob object cannot be
    written (because the corresponding `.git/objects/??/` directory may be
    owned by `root`) but the tree object can be written (because the
    corresponding objects directory is owned by the current user). This
    would result in a corrupt repository because it is missing the blob
    object, and with this here patch we prevent that.
    
    Note: This patch adjusts two variable declarations from `unsigned` to
    `int` because their purpose is to hold the return value of
    `handle_content_merge()`, which is of type `int`. The existing users of
    those variables are only interested whether that variable is zero or
    non-zero, therefore this type change does not affect the existing code.

Running the second command yieled a similar output. Here is the original commit with commit id, code changes, and author:

commit 0b55d930a69692c7f4e7b90e35fa41f6c46df4bc

    merge-ort: fix segmentation fault in read-only repositories
    
    If the blob/tree objects cannot be written, we really need the merge
    operations to fail, and not to continue (and then try to access the tree
    object which is however still set to `NULL`).
    
    Let's stop ignoring the return value of `write_object_file()` and
    `write_tree()` and set `clean = -1` in the error case.

I've included 1.txt and 2.txt to represent the commands listed above respectively, which include the output of git show [commit id] for each actual commit (code changes).
