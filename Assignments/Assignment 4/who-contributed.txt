First, I searched for the the commit that first introduced the phrase "Even newspaper..." with the command: 'git log -S"Even newspaper reports present contradictory information." --all --reverse -p'
I used -S to search for commits which add/remove the string, --all to check all branches, -p to see the patch/changes for the commit, and --reverse to see the changes in reverse chronological order (oldest first). From this, I found one result:

commit c12b432741eed9a422fbf99fa27af6e7a941d88b

Then, ran the command: 'git blame -L "/Even newspaper reports/,+1" northamerica' to find out whe and who last modified the line containing the phrase in question and got:

c8f960ec7 (Paul Eggert 2013-09-02 08:09:06 -0700 883) # and wrote "Even newspaper reports present contradictory information."

So, I can say that the line originated in the tzdb files in 1995 from Arthur David Olson, while the latest change was by Paul Eggert in 2013.
