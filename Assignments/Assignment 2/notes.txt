(*
 (expt 2 (- 607 1))
 (- (expt 2 607) 1)
)

log(N) = log( 2^606 * (2^607-1))
= log(2^606) + log(2^607 -1)
= 606 + log(2^607 -1)
= 1213

In EMACS: (+ (log (- (expt 2 607) 1) 2 ) 606)

C-h b results:
C-h k = describe-key
M-SPC = cycle-spacing

When typing C-h k C-h k, emacs opens the basic description of "C-h k" because "C-h k" is a "describe-key" command being pointed at itself, so it will describe its own function. 
When typing C-h M-SPC, emacs opens documentation for M-SPC, which cycles spacing as described in C-h b. 

The more general function is just-one-space, which removes all spaces preceding the cursor except for 1. In M-SPC, if you press M-SPC again, it removes that last space as well. Repeatedly typing M-SPC will loop through this process from the beginning. 

Homework: Python Scripting
My shuf.py script runs as expected in both python 2 and python 3. My script does not utilize any new, python3 exclusive features. 

Benchmarks:
Normal shuf:
user: 0m0.064s
sys: 0m0.016s

My shuf (pre 3.11 (/usr/bin/python))
user: 0m0.642s
sys: 0m0.048s

My shuf (3.11+ (/usr/local/cs/bin/python))
user: 0m0.575s
sys: 0m0.041s

My shuf.py script works on both versions of python (3.13.1 and 3.9.21).
